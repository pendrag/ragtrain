    "question": "Why is controllable and reproducible cosmological experiments important for real-time semiclassical lattice simulations?",

    "paragraph": "One of the fundamental challenges of cosmology is that it is an observational science, not an experimental one: one has no control over the system in question (the Universe), and can only access a single realization of it, which is drawn from an inherently stochastic quantum process. The task of reconstructing the underlying physical laws from within this one realization, without any freedom to vary parameters or conduct controlled experiments, is a daunting one. This problem is particularly acute for the very early Universe, for which observational data are scarce and the underlying physics is poorly understood. These challenges have driven a recent surge of interest in simulating early-Universe theories using quantum analog experiments [1–34]. By emulating the behavior of relativistic fields, these analogs enable controllable and reproducible cosmological experiments, with transformative potential for our understanding of fundamental physics. Vacuum decay is an emblematic use case for such analogs. This process, in which a relativistic scalar field decays from a metastable ‘false vacuum’ state by nucleating bubbles of true vacuum [35, 36], is both nonperturbative and inherently quantum, such that any analytical description or numerical simulation must resort to approximations and assumptions. Analog simulations of vacuum decay promise to provide the first empirical tests of these descriptions, potentially revealing interesting new phenomenology (including bubble clustering [37, 38], dynamical precursors [39], and time-dependent decay rates [40– 42]), with implications for inflation [43–47], baryogene∗Corresponding author; acj46@cam.ac.uk sis [48–50], gravitational waves [51–53], and Higgs vacuum stability [54–56]. Recent years have seen significant progress toward simulating vacuum decay using ultra-cold atomic condensates, including theoretical developments in modeling these systems and understanding the regimes in which they behave relativistically [1–13], as well as successful experimental realization of nonrelativistic vacuum decay in inhomogeneous condensates [14]. The ultimate goal is to simulate vacuum decay in a system that (i) has a well-defined relativistic regime, and (ii) is as homogeneous as possible, in order to recreate the conditions relevant to early-Universe theories. Efforts toward this goal are currently ongoing at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge as part of the QSimFP Consortium,1 using an optical box trap [57, 58] to ensure homogeneity across the bulk of the condensate. However, any cold-atom experiment will inevitably be inhomogeneous at its boundary, where the walls of the optical box force the atomic density to zero. As we demonstrate below, this is a potentially serious problem for efforts to simulate vacuum decay, as these inhomogeneities generically catalyze rapid nucleation of bubbles on the boundary of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is of cosmological interest. This accelerated decay due to boundary effects was previously observed numerically in Ref. [11], and is closely related to the phenomenon of seeded decay [5, 59–61]. In this paper, we show that this issue of edge nucleation can be eliminated by appropriately engineering the trapping potential to create a ‘trench’ of high atomic density at the boundary. We demonstrate this analytically 1 https://qsimfp.org/ arXiv:2504.02829v1  [cond-mat.quant-gas]  3 Apr 2025   2 in Sec.

    "paragraph": "We begin by briefly reviewing the cold-atom analog system studied in Refs. [12, 13], as well as the Euclidean description of bulk bubble nucleation in the thin-wall limit [35, 36]. We then consider edge nucleation in this limit, showing that this is exponentially enhanced in the case of a standard box trap, before demonstrating how a high-density boundary layer eliminates this problem. Our treatment in this section is inspired by the approach in Ref. [61], where similar thin-wall calculations were used to study the seeding of bubbles by impurities in the bulk. A. The relativistic analog Our system is a dilute gas of two internal states of a bosonic isotope, which we label |↓⟩and |↑⟩. At sufficiently low temperature, each species forms a Bose-Einstein condensate described by a many-body wavefunction with number density n and phase ϕ, ψ↓= √n↓exp(iϕ↓), ψ↑= √n↑exp(iϕ↑). (1) As well as nonlinear interactions due to two-body scattering, the two condensates interact via a Rabi coupling (i.e., a coherent electromagnetic beam with frequency corresponding to the energy splitting between the two atomic states) whose amplitude is rapidly modulated in time. On timescales much longer than the modulation period, this generates an effective potential for the relative phase field ϕ = ϕ↓−ϕ↑. Under suitable experimental conditions, the equation of motion for ϕ becomes that of a relativistic scalar field, (−c−2 ϕ ∂2 t + ∇2)ϕ = U ′(ϕ), (2) with a periodic potential, U(ϕ) = ϵ m2 ϕc2 ϕ ℏ2 \u0012 1 −cos ϕ + λ2 2 sin2 ϕ \u0013 . (3) Here cϕ is the sound speed of the relative phase phonons, which plays the role of the speed of light in the effective relativistic theory, while mϕ is an associated mass scale, which is comparable to the atomic mass m. The dimensionless constants ϵ and λ are associated with the Bucket Potential Zero density False vacuum True vacuum θ σfv σtv σb Figure 1. Illustration of edge nucleation in the thin-wall limit. The balance of surface tensions determines the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary. Here we show a simple ‘bucket’ trap, where the density goes to zero at the boundary. In this case we find θ = π/2, so that edge nucleation forms half a bubble. For traps with a high-density ‘trench’ region that remains trapped in the false vacuum, we instead find θ = π. Edge nucleation is then disfavored, and it is only possible to form whole bubbles in the bulk. mean amplitude and modulation amplitude of the Rabi coupling, respectively, with ϵ ≪1 required to obtain the effective relativistic equation of motion (2). For λ > 1, the potential (3) contains metastable local minima at ϕ = π (mod 2π), so that a system initialized in one of these states can undergo vacuum decay, spontaneously nucleating bubbles of ‘true vacuum’ in which ϕ = 0 (mod 2π). These nucleation events can be described in terms of a ‘bounce’ solution ϕb(τ, x) to the equation of motion (2) in Euclidean time τ = it. Here the crucial quantity is the Euclidean action of this solution, S = Z dτ Z ddx \u0014 1 2c2 ϕ (∂τϕb)2 + 1 2|∇ϕb|2 + U(ϕb) −U(ϕfv) \u0015 , (4) which sets the nucleation rate, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In the limit where the bubble wall (i.e., the region over which the field interpolates between the true and false vacua) has thickness much smaller than the radius of the bubble, the action can be written as S = A σb −V ∆U, (5) where A and V are the surface area and volume of the bubble in the (d + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space, σb is the surface tension of the bubble wall, and ∆U = U(ϕfv) −U(ϕtv) = 2ϵ(mϕcϕ/ℏ)2 is the excess energy density associated with the false vacuum. This thin-wall approximation is valid when the potential barrier separating the vacua is large, λ ≫1, while still keeping ϵλ2 ≪1 to ensure the relativistic analogy holds. This implies a hierarchy of scales between the critical bubble radius R, the bubble wall thickness ℓ, and the scale associated with   3 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 r/ξ −1 0 1 2 3 V (r)/µ, n(r)/nbulk Bucket Trench Figure 2. The two trapping potentials we use in our 2D simulations in units of the chemical potential µ = ℏ2/(2mξ2) (solid curves), along with their corresponding ground-state profiles for the mean density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 (dashed curves and shaded regions). Both are circularly symmetric, depending only on the radial coordinate r (measured here in units of the healing length ξ). Shown in blue is a bucket trap, with a sharp wall at r ≈50 ξ. Shown in red is a trap with a trench layer, in which the density reaches double its bulk value. density gradients in the condensate (known as the healing length) ξ, R ∼λℓ≫ℓ, ℓ∼ξ/ϵ1/2 ≫ξ. (6) In practice the analog experiments will most likely have λ not much larger than unity, as this enhances the decay rate, and therefore increases the probability of seeing bubbles in a given experimental run. However, the analytical results we obtain below using the thin-wall approximation still give useful insights into edge nucleation. We confirm these insights numerically in the thick-wall regime in Sec. III. B. Edge nucleation The discussion above describes homogeneous bulk nucleation in the interior region far from the walls of the box trap; we now consider nucleation on the boundary, assuming a simple ‘bucket’ potential of the kind shown in Fig. 2, which transitions sharply from zero potential in the bulk to a large value at the edge of the system. The atomic number densities n↓, n↑are forced to zero at this edge, and ‘heal’ back to their bulk values over a lengthscale ξ. The resulting density profile is sensitive to the relative phase ϕ, due to the associated energy density (3). There are thus three different interfaces to consider, each with its own surface tension: the false vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σfv; the true vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σtv; and the bulk false vacuum–true vacuum interface (i.e., the bubble wall), with tension σb. These are illustrated in Fig. 1. By resolving forces at the point where these three surfaces meet, we find that the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary is set by cos θ = σfv −σtv σb . (7) This is a well-known result in fluid mechanics, where it is called the Young equation [61, 63, 64]. Since we have a microphysical description of the system, one can calculate each of the three surface tensions in Eq. (7) to determine the contact angle analytically. We describe this calculation in App. A. The key finding is that σfv −σtv = O(ϵ), σb = O(ϵ1/2). (8) Heuristically, this is because the energy densities involved are O(ϵ) in each case, but the bubble wall is thicker than the healing length by a factor ∼ϵ−1/2, cf. Eq. (6). Since we require ϵ ≪1 to obtain a relativistic analog, Eq. (7) implies θ ≃π/2, (9) i.e., the bubble wall must be perpendicular to the boundary at the point of contact. For a planar boundary, this means that edge nucleation forms exactly half a bubble. This is potentially a serious problem for cold-atom vacuum decay analogs, as can be appreciated by considering the Euclidean action (5). Since the volume and surface area of an edge bubble are halved compared to a bubble in the bulk, so is its action, Sedge ≃1 2Sbulk. (10) Edge nucleation is therefore much faster than bulk nucleation, due to the exponential sensitivity of the decay rate to the Euclidean action, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In principle one should include an additional term in the action to account for the excess tension at the true vacuum–boundary interface, σtv −σfv, but since this is suppressed by a factor ∼ϵ1/2 compared to σb it has negligible effect on the decay rate. An immediate consequence of this perpendicular contact angle is that any corners in the box trap will give rise to even faster edge nucleation, as these will form an even smaller fraction of a bulk bubble (e.g., a quarter of a bubble in the case of a right-angled corner in a 2D system); this effect can be seen in the results of Ref. [11]. This is why we consider a circular trap geometry in our simulations in Sec. III. Circular symmetry is also convenient for numerical reasons, as discussed in App. B. C. Eliminating edge nucleation The solution to the problem identified above is to modify the contact angle θ by engineering the trapping potential, adding further structure beyond a bucket trap. This could be implemented in practice using, e.g., a digital   4 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 n(r)/nbulk −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 cos[φ(t, x)] Bucket Trench Density proﬁle Initial state Post-nucleation Time evolution −→ Figure 3. Representative results from our 2D lattice simulations. The top row shows a bucket potential, while the bottom row shows a trench potential. White dotted circles in the bottom row show the inner edge of the trench. In the bucket, the initial false vacuum state (blue) decays by nucleating edge bubbles (red), which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2. In the trench, edge nucleation is prevented, and the decay occurs instead via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk. The resulting bubbles are more noticeably aspherical due to the different physical parameters being simulated, which correspond to a shallower effective potential around the false vacuum. micromirror device to sculpt an optical potential with the desired profile [65, 66]. In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk. As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem.

As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem.

    "paragraph": "We begin by briefly reviewing the cold-atom analog system studied in Refs. [12, 13], as well as the Euclidean description of bulk bubble nucleation in the thin-wall limit [35, 36]. We then consider edge nucleation in this limit, showing that this is exponentially enhanced in the case of a standard box trap, before demonstrating how a high-density boundary layer eliminates this problem. Our treatment in this section is inspired by the approach in Ref. [61], where similar thin-wall calculations were used to study the seeding of bubbles by impurities in the bulk. A. The relativistic analog Our system is a dilute gas of two internal states of a bosonic isotope, which we label |↓⟩and |↑⟩. At sufficiently low temperature, each species forms a Bose-Einstein condensate described by a many-body wavefunction with number density n and phase ϕ, ψ↓= √n↓exp(iϕ↓), ψ↑= √n↑exp(iϕ↑). (1) As well as nonlinear interactions due to two-body scattering, the two condensates interact via a Rabi coupling (i.e., a coherent electromagnetic beam with frequency corresponding to the energy splitting between the two atomic states) whose amplitude is rapidly modulated in time. On timescales much longer than the modulation period, this generates an effective potential for the relative phase field ϕ = ϕ↓−ϕ↑. Under suitable experimental conditions, the equation of motion for ϕ becomes that of a relativistic scalar field, (−c−2 ϕ ∂2 t + ∇2)ϕ = U ′(ϕ), (2) with a periodic potential, U(ϕ) = ϵ m2 ϕc2 ϕ ℏ2 \u0012 1 −cos ϕ + λ2 2 sin2 ϕ \u0013 . (3) Here cϕ is the sound speed of the relative phase phonons, which plays the role of the speed of light in the effective relativistic theory, while mϕ is an associated mass scale, which is comparable to the atomic mass m. The dimensionless constants ϵ and λ are associated with the Bucket Potential Zero density False vacuum True vacuum θ σfv σtv σb Figure 1. Illustration of edge nucleation in the thin-wall limit. The balance of surface tensions determines the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary. Here we show a simple ‘bucket’ trap, where the density goes to zero at the boundary. In this case we find θ = π/2, so that edge nucleation forms half a bubble. For traps with a high-density ‘trench’ region that remains trapped in the false vacuum, we instead find θ = π. Edge nucleation is then disfavored, and it is only possible to form whole bubbles in the bulk. mean amplitude and modulation amplitude of the Rabi coupling, respectively, with ϵ ≪1 required to obtain the effective relativistic equation of motion (2). For λ > 1, the potential (3) contains metastable local minima at ϕ = π (mod 2π), so that a system initialized in one of these states can undergo vacuum decay, spontaneously nucleating bubbles of ‘true vacuum’ in which ϕ = 0 (mod 2π). These nucleation events can be described in terms of a ‘bounce’ solution ϕb(τ, x) to the equation of motion (2) in Euclidean time τ = it. Here the crucial quantity is the Euclidean action of this solution, S = Z dτ Z ddx \u0014 1 2c2 ϕ (∂τϕb)2 + 1 2|∇ϕb|2 + U(ϕb) −U(ϕfv) \u0015 , (4) which sets the nucleation rate, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In the limit where the bubble wall (i.e., the region over which the field interpolates between the true and false vacua) has thickness much smaller than the radius of the bubble, the action can be written as S = A σb −V ∆U, (5) where A and V are the surface area and volume of the bubble in the (d + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space, σb is the surface tension of the bubble wall, and ∆U = U(ϕfv) −U(ϕtv) = 2ϵ(mϕcϕ/ℏ)2 is the excess energy density associated with the false vacuum. This thin-wall approximation is valid when the potential barrier separating the vacua is large, λ ≫1, while still keeping ϵλ2 ≪1 to ensure the relativistic analogy holds. This implies a hierarchy of scales between the critical bubble radius R, the bubble wall thickness ℓ, and the scale associated with   3 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 r/ξ −1 0 1 2 3 V (r)/µ, n(r)/nbulk Bucket Trench Figure 2. The two trapping potentials we use in our 2D simulations in units of the chemical potential µ = ℏ2/(2mξ2) (solid curves), along with their corresponding ground-state profiles for the mean density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 (dashed curves and shaded regions). Both are circularly symmetric, depending only on the radial coordinate r (measured here in units of the healing length ξ). Shown in blue is a bucket trap, with a sharp wall at r ≈50 ξ. Shown in red is a trap with a trench layer, in which the density reaches double its bulk value. density gradients in the condensate (known as the healing length) ξ, R ∼λℓ≫ℓ, ℓ∼ξ/ϵ1/2 ≫ξ. (6) In practice the analog experiments will most likely have λ not much larger than unity, as this enhances the decay rate, and therefore increases the probability of seeing bubbles in a given experimental run. However, the analytical results we obtain below using the thin-wall approximation still give useful insights into edge nucleation. We confirm these insights numerically in the thick-wall regime in Sec. III. B. Edge nucleation The discussion above describes homogeneous bulk nucleation in the interior region far from the walls of the box trap; we now consider nucleation on the boundary, assuming a simple ‘bucket’ potential of the kind shown in Fig. 2, which transitions sharply from zero potential in the bulk to a large value at the edge of the system. The atomic number densities n↓, n↑are forced to zero at this edge, and ‘heal’ back to their bulk values over a lengthscale ξ. The resulting density profile is sensitive to the relative phase ϕ, due to the associated energy density (3). There are thus three different interfaces to consider, each with its own surface tension: the false vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σfv; the true vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σtv; and the bulk false vacuum–true vacuum interface (i.e., the bubble wall), with tension σb. These are illustrated in Fig. 1. By resolving forces at the point where these three surfaces meet, we find that the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary is set by cos θ = σfv −σtv σb . (7) This is a well-known result in fluid mechanics, where it is called the Young equation [61, 63, 64]. Since we have a microphysical description of the system, one can calculate each of the three surface tensions in Eq. (7) to determine the contact angle analytically. We describe this calculation in App. A. The key finding is that σfv −σtv = O(ϵ), σb = O(ϵ1/2). (8) Heuristically, this is because the energy densities involved are O(ϵ) in each case, but the bubble wall is thicker than the healing length by a factor ∼ϵ−1/2, cf. Eq. (6). Since we require ϵ ≪1 to obtain a relativistic analog, Eq. (7) implies θ ≃π/2, (9) i.e., the bubble wall must be perpendicular to the boundary at the point of contact. For a planar boundary, this means that edge nucleation forms exactly half a bubble. This is potentially a serious problem for cold-atom vacuum decay analogs, as can be appreciated by considering the Euclidean action (5). Since the volume and surface area of an edge bubble are halved compared to a bubble in the bulk, so is its action, Sedge ≃1 2Sbulk. (10) Edge nucleation is therefore much faster than bulk nucleation, due to the exponential sensitivity of the decay rate to the Euclidean action, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In principle one should include an additional term in the action to account for the excess tension at the true vacuum–boundary interface, σtv −σfv, but since this is suppressed by a factor ∼ϵ1/2 compared to σb it has negligible effect on the decay rate. An immediate consequence of this perpendicular contact angle is that any corners in the box trap will give rise to even faster edge nucleation, as these will form an even smaller fraction of a bulk bubble (e.g., a quarter of a bubble in the case of a right-angled corner in a 2D system); this effect can be seen in the results of Ref. [11]. This is why we consider a circular trap geometry in our simulations in Sec. III. Circular symmetry is also convenient for numerical reasons, as discussed in App. B. C. Eliminating edge nucleation The solution to the problem identified above is to modify the contact angle θ by engineering the trapping potential, adding further structure beyond a bucket trap. This could be implemented in practice using, e.g., a digital   4 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 n(r)/nbulk −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 cos[φ(t, x)] Bucket Trench Density proﬁle Initial state Post-nucleation Time evolution −→ Figure 3. Representative results from our 2D lattice simulations. The top row shows a bucket potential, while the bottom row shows a trench potential. White dotted circles in the bottom row show the inner edge of the trench. In the bucket, the initial false vacuum state (blue) decays by nucleating edge bubbles (red), which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2. In the trench, edge nucleation is prevented, and the decay occurs instead via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk. The resulting bubbles are more noticeably aspherical due to the different physical parameters being simulated, which correspond to a shallower effective potential around the false vacuum. micromirror device to sculpt an optical potential with the desired profile [65, 66]. In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2).

In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk. As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem.

    "paragraph": "We begin by briefly reviewing the cold-atom analog system studied in Refs. [12, 13], as well as the Euclidean description of bulk bubble nucleation in the thin-wall limit [35, 36]. We then consider edge nucleation in this limit, showing that this is exponentially enhanced in the case of a standard box trap, before demonstrating how a high-density boundary layer eliminates this problem. Our treatment in this section is inspired by the approach in Ref. [61], where similar thin-wall calculations were used to study the seeding of bubbles by impurities in the bulk. A. The relativistic analog Our system is a dilute gas of two internal states of a bosonic isotope, which we label |↓⟩and |↑⟩. At sufficiently low temperature, each species forms a Bose-Einstein condensate described by a many-body wavefunction with number density n and phase ϕ, ψ↓= √n↓exp(iϕ↓), ψ↑= √n↑exp(iϕ↑). (1) As well as nonlinear interactions due to two-body scattering, the two condensates interact via a Rabi coupling (i.e., a coherent electromagnetic beam with frequency corresponding to the energy splitting between the two atomic states) whose amplitude is rapidly modulated in time. On timescales much longer than the modulation period, this generates an effective potential for the relative phase field ϕ = ϕ↓−ϕ↑. Under suitable experimental conditions, the equation of motion for ϕ becomes that of a relativistic scalar field, (−c−2 ϕ ∂2 t + ∇2)ϕ = U ′(ϕ), (2) with a periodic potential, U(ϕ) = ϵ m2 ϕc2 ϕ ℏ2 \u0012 1 −cos ϕ + λ2 2 sin2 ϕ \u0013 . (3) Here cϕ is the sound speed of the relative phase phonons, which plays the role of the speed of light in the effective relativistic theory, while mϕ is an associated mass scale, which is comparable to the atomic mass m. The dimensionless constants ϵ and λ are associated with the Bucket Potential Zero density False vacuum True vacuum θ σfv σtv σb Figure 1. Illustration of edge nucleation in the thin-wall limit. The balance of surface tensions determines the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary. Here we show a simple ‘bucket’ trap, where the density goes to zero at the boundary. In this case we find θ = π/2, so that edge nucleation forms half a bubble. For traps with a high-density ‘trench’ region that remains trapped in the false vacuum, we instead find θ = π. Edge nucleation is then disfavored, and it is only possible to form whole bubbles in the bulk. mean amplitude and modulation amplitude of the Rabi coupling, respectively, with ϵ ≪1 required to obtain the effective relativistic equation of motion (2). For λ > 1, the potential (3) contains metastable local minima at ϕ = π (mod 2π), so that a system initialized in one of these states can undergo vacuum decay, spontaneously nucleating bubbles of ‘true vacuum’ in which ϕ = 0 (mod 2π). These nucleation events can be described in terms of a ‘bounce’ solution ϕb(τ, x) to the equation of motion (2) in Euclidean time τ = it. Here the crucial quantity is the Euclidean action of this solution, S = Z dτ Z ddx \u0014 1 2c2 ϕ (∂τϕb)2 + 1 2|∇ϕb|2 + U(ϕb) −U(ϕfv) \u0015 , (4) which sets the nucleation rate, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In the limit where the bubble wall (i.e., the region over which the field interpolates between the true and false vacua) has thickness much smaller than the radius of the bubble, the action can be written as S = A σb −V ∆U, (5) where A and V are the surface area and volume of the bubble in the (d + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space, σb is the surface tension of the bubble wall, and ∆U = U(ϕfv) −U(ϕtv) = 2ϵ(mϕcϕ/ℏ)2 is the excess energy density associated with the false vacuum. This thin-wall approximation is valid when the potential barrier separating the vacua is large, λ ≫1, while still keeping ϵλ2 ≪1 to ensure the relativistic analogy holds. This implies a hierarchy of scales between the critical bubble radius R, the bubble wall thickness ℓ, and the scale associated with   3 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 r/ξ −1 0 1 2 3 V (r)/µ, n(r)/nbulk Bucket Trench Figure 2. The two trapping potentials we use in our 2D simulations in units of the chemical potential µ = ℏ2/(2mξ2) (solid curves), along with their corresponding ground-state profiles for the mean density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 (dashed curves and shaded regions). Both are circularly symmetric, depending only on the radial coordinate r (measured here in units of the healing length ξ). Shown in blue is a bucket trap, with a sharp wall at r ≈50 ξ. Shown in red is a trap with a trench layer, in which the density reaches double its bulk value. density gradients in the condensate (known as the healing length) ξ, R ∼λℓ≫ℓ, ℓ∼ξ/ϵ1/2 ≫ξ. (6) In practice the analog experiments will most likely have λ not much larger than unity, as this enhances the decay rate, and therefore increases the probability of seeing bubbles in a given experimental run. However, the analytical results we obtain below using the thin-wall approximation still give useful insights into edge nucleation. We confirm these insights numerically in the thick-wall regime in Sec. III. B. Edge nucleation The discussion above describes homogeneous bulk nucleation in the interior region far from the walls of the box trap; we now consider nucleation on the boundary, assuming a simple ‘bucket’ potential of the kind shown in Fig. 2, which transitions sharply from zero potential in the bulk to a large value at the edge of the system. The atomic number densities n↓, n↑are forced to zero at this edge, and ‘heal’ back to their bulk values over a lengthscale ξ. The resulting density profile is sensitive to the relative phase ϕ, due to the associated energy density (3). There are thus three different interfaces to consider, each with its own surface tension: the false vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σfv; the true vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σtv; and the bulk false vacuum–true vacuum interface (i.e., the bubble wall), with tension σb. These are illustrated in Fig. 1. By resolving forces at the point where these three surfaces meet, we find that the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary is set by cos θ = σfv −σtv σb . (7) This is a well-known result in fluid mechanics, where it is called the Young equation [61, 63, 64]. Since we have a microphysical description of the system, one can calculate each of the three surface tensions in Eq. (7) to determine the contact angle analytically. We describe this calculation in App. A. The key finding is that σfv −σtv = O(ϵ), σb = O(ϵ1/2). (8) Heuristically, this is because the energy densities involved are O(ϵ) in each case, but the bubble wall is thicker than the healing length by a factor ∼ϵ−1/2, cf. Eq. (6). Since we require ϵ ≪1 to obtain a relativistic analog, Eq. (7) implies θ ≃π/2, (9) i.e., the bubble wall must be perpendicular to the boundary at the point of contact. For a planar boundary, this means that edge nucleation forms exactly half a bubble. This is potentially a serious problem for cold-atom vacuum decay analogs, as can be appreciated by considering the Euclidean action (5). Since the volume and surface area of an edge bubble are halved compared to a bubble in the bulk, so is its action, Sedge ≃1 2Sbulk. (10) Edge nucleation is therefore much faster than bulk nucleation, due to the exponential sensitivity of the decay rate to the Euclidean action, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In principle one should include an additional term in the action to account for the excess tension at the true vacuum–boundary interface, σtv −σfv, but since this is suppressed by a factor ∼ϵ1/2 compared to σb it has negligible effect on the decay rate. An immediate consequence of this perpendicular contact angle is that any corners in the box trap will give rise to even faster edge nucleation, as these will form an even smaller fraction of a bulk bubble (e.g., a quarter of a bubble in the case of a right-angled corner in a 2D system); this effect can be seen in the results of Ref. [11]. This is why we consider a circular trap geometry in our simulations in Sec. III. Circular symmetry is also convenient for numerical reasons, as discussed in App. B. C.

Since we require ϵ ≪1 to obtain a relativistic analog, Eq. (7) implies θ ≃π/2, (9) i.e., the bubble wall must be perpendicular to the boundary at the point of contact. For a planar boundary, this means that edge nucleation forms exactly half a bubble. This is potentially a serious problem for cold-atom vacuum decay analogs, as can be appreciated by considering the Euclidean action (5). Since the volume and surface area of an edge bubble are halved compared to a bubble in the bulk, so is its action, Sedge ≃1 2Sbulk. (10) Edge nucleation is therefore much faster than bulk nucleation, due to the exponential sensitivity of the decay rate to the Euclidean action, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In principle one should include an additional term in the action to account for the excess tension at the true vacuum–boundary interface, σtv −σfv, but since this is suppressed by a factor ∼ϵ1/2 compared to σb it has negligible effect on the decay rate. An immediate consequence of this perpendicular contact angle is that any corners in the box trap will give rise to even faster edge nucleation, as these will form an even smaller fraction of a bulk bubble (e.g., a quarter of a bubble in the case of a right-angled corner in a 2D system); this effect can be seen in the results of Ref. [11]. This is why we consider a circular trap geometry in our simulations in Sec. III. Circular symmetry is also convenient for numerical reasons, as discussed in App. B. C. Eliminating edge nucleation The solution to the problem identified above is to modify the contact angle θ by engineering the trapping potential, adding further structure beyond a bucket trap. This could be implemented in practice using, e.g., a digital   4 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 n(r)/nbulk −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 cos[φ(t, x)] Bucket Trench Density proﬁle Initial state Post-nucleation Time evolution −→ Figure 3.

White dotted circles in the bottom row show the inner edge of the trench. In the bucket, the initial false vacuum state (blue) decays by nucleating edge bubbles (red), which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2. In the trench, edge nucleation is prevented, and the decay occurs instead via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk. The resulting bubbles are more noticeably aspherical due to the different physical parameters being simulated, which correspond to a shallower effective potential around the false vacuum. micromirror device to sculpt an optical potential with the desired profile [65, 66]. In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk. As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem.

    "paragraph": "We begin by briefly reviewing the cold-atom analog system studied in Refs. [12, 13], as well as the Euclidean description of bulk bubble nucleation in the thin-wall limit [35, 36]. We then consider edge nucleation in this limit, showing that this is exponentially enhanced in the case of a standard box trap, before demonstrating how a high-density boundary layer eliminates this problem. Our treatment in this section is inspired by the approach in Ref. [61], where similar thin-wall calculations were used to study the seeding of bubbles by impurities in the bulk. A. The relativistic analog Our system is a dilute gas of two internal states of a bosonic isotope, which we label |↓⟩and |↑⟩. At sufficiently low temperature, each species forms a Bose-Einstein condensate described by a many-body wavefunction with number density n and phase ϕ, ψ↓= √n↓exp(iϕ↓), ψ↑= √n↑exp(iϕ↑). (1) As well as nonlinear interactions due to two-body scattering, the two condensates interact via a Rabi coupling (i.e., a coherent electromagnetic beam with frequency corresponding to the energy splitting between the two atomic states) whose amplitude is rapidly modulated in time. On timescales much longer than the modulation period, this generates an effective potential for the relative phase field ϕ = ϕ↓−ϕ↑. Under suitable experimental conditions, the equation of motion for ϕ becomes that of a relativistic scalar field, (−c−2 ϕ ∂2 t + ∇2)ϕ = U ′(ϕ), (2) with a periodic potential, U(ϕ) = ϵ m2 ϕc2 ϕ ℏ2 \u0012 1 −cos ϕ + λ2 2 sin2 ϕ \u0013 .

The balance of surface tensions determines the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary. Here we show a simple ‘bucket’ trap, where the density goes to zero at the boundary. In this case we find θ = π/2, so that edge nucleation forms half a bubble. For traps with a high-density ‘trench’ region that remains trapped in the false vacuum, we instead find θ = π. Edge nucleation is then disfavored, and it is only possible to form whole bubbles in the bulk. mean amplitude and modulation amplitude of the Rabi coupling, respectively, with ϵ ≪1 required to obtain the effective relativistic equation of motion (2). For λ > 1, the potential (3) contains metastable local minima at ϕ = π (mod 2π), so that a system initialized in one of these states can undergo vacuum decay, spontaneously nucleating bubbles of ‘true vacuum’ in which ϕ = 0 (mod 2π). These nucleation events can be described in terms of a ‘bounce’ solution ϕb(τ, x) to the equation of motion (2) in Euclidean time τ = it. Here the crucial quantity is the Euclidean action of this solution, S = Z dτ Z ddx \u0014 1 2c2 ϕ (∂τϕb)2 + 1 2|∇ϕb|2 + U(ϕb) −U(ϕfv) \u0015 , (4) which sets the nucleation rate, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In the limit where the bubble wall (i.e., the region over which the field interpolates between the true and false vacua) has thickness much smaller than the radius of the bubble, the action can be written as S = A σb −V ∆U, (5) where A and V are the surface area and volume of the bubble in the (d + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space, σb is the surface tension of the bubble wall, and ∆U = U(ϕfv) −U(ϕtv) = 2ϵ(mϕcϕ/ℏ)2 is the excess energy density associated with the false vacuum. This thin-wall approximation is valid when the potential barrier separating the vacua is large, λ ≫1, while still keeping ϵλ2 ≪1 to ensure the relativistic analogy holds.

Both are circularly symmetric, depending only on the radial coordinate r (measured here in units of the healing length ξ). Shown in blue is a bucket trap, with a sharp wall at r ≈50 ξ. Shown in red is a trap with a trench layer, in which the density reaches double its bulk value. density gradients in the condensate (known as the healing length) ξ, R ∼λℓ≫ℓ, ℓ∼ξ/ϵ1/2 ≫ξ. (6) In practice the analog experiments will most likely have λ not much larger than unity, as this enhances the decay rate, and therefore increases the probability of seeing bubbles in a given experimental run. However, the analytical results we obtain below using the thin-wall approximation still give useful insights into edge nucleation. We confirm these insights numerically in the thick-wall regime in Sec. III. B. Edge nucleation The discussion above describes homogeneous bulk nucleation in the interior region far from the walls of the box trap; we now consider nucleation on the boundary, assuming a simple ‘bucket’ potential of the kind shown in Fig. 2, which transitions sharply from zero potential in the bulk to a large value at the edge of the system. The atomic number densities n↓, n↑are forced to zero at this edge, and ‘heal’ back to their bulk values over a lengthscale ξ. The resulting density profile is sensitive to the relative phase ϕ, due to the associated energy density (3). There are thus three different interfaces to consider, each with its own surface tension: the false vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σfv; the true vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σtv; and the bulk false vacuum–true vacuum interface (i.e., the bubble wall), with tension σb. These are illustrated in Fig. 1. By resolving forces at the point where these three surfaces meet, we find that the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary is set by cos θ = σfv −σtv σb . (7) This is a well-known result in fluid mechanics, where it is called the Young equation [61, 63, 64]. Since we have a microphysical description of the system, one can calculate each of the three surface tensions in Eq. (7) to determine the contact angle analytically. We describe this calculation in App. A. The key finding is that σfv −σtv = O(ϵ), σb = O(ϵ1/2). (8) Heuristically, this is because the energy densities involved are O(ϵ) in each case, but the bubble wall is thicker than the healing length by a factor ∼ϵ−1/2, cf. Eq. (6).

Edge nucleation The discussion above describes homogeneous bulk nucleation in the interior region far from the walls of the box trap; we now consider nucleation on the boundary, assuming a simple ‘bucket’ potential of the kind shown in Fig. 2, which transitions sharply from zero potential in the bulk to a large value at the edge of the system. The atomic number densities n↓, n↑are forced to zero at this edge, and ‘heal’ back to their bulk values over a lengthscale ξ. The resulting density profile is sensitive to the relative phase ϕ, due to the associated energy density (3). There are thus three different interfaces to consider, each with its own surface tension: the false vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σfv; the true vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σtv; and the bulk false vacuum–true vacuum interface (i.e., the bubble wall), with tension σb. These are illustrated in Fig. 1. By resolving forces at the point where these three surfaces meet, we find that the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary is set by cos θ = σfv −σtv σb . (7) This is a well-known result in fluid mechanics, where it is called the Young equation [61, 63, 64]. Since we have a microphysical description of the system, one can calculate each of the three surface tensions in Eq. (7) to determine the contact angle analytically. We describe this calculation in App. A. The key finding is that σfv −σtv = O(ϵ), σb = O(ϵ1/2). (8) Heuristically, this is because the energy densities involved are O(ϵ) in each case, but the bubble wall is thicker than the healing length by a factor ∼ϵ−1/2, cf. Eq. (6). Since we require ϵ ≪1 to obtain a relativistic analog, Eq. (7) implies θ ≃π/2, (9) i.e., the bubble wall must be perpendicular to the boundary at the point of contact. For a planar boundary, this means that edge nucleation forms exactly half a bubble. This is potentially a serious problem for cold-atom vacuum decay analogs, as can be appreciated by considering the Euclidean action (5). Since the volume and surface area of an edge bubble are halved compared to a bubble in the bulk, so is its action, Sedge ≃1 2Sbulk. (10) Edge nucleation is therefore much faster than bulk nucleation, due to the exponential sensitivity of the decay rate to the Euclidean action, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In principle one should include an additional term in the action to account for the excess tension at the true vacuum–boundary interface, σtv −σfv, but since this is suppressed by a factor ∼ϵ1/2 compared to σb it has negligible effect on the decay rate. An immediate consequence of this perpendicular contact angle is that any corners in the box trap will give rise to even faster edge nucleation, as these will form an even smaller fraction of a bulk bubble (e.g., a quarter of a bubble in the case of a right-angled corner in a 2D system); this effect can be seen in the results of Ref. [11]. This is why we consider a circular trap geometry in our simulations in Sec. III. Circular symmetry is also convenient for numerical reasons, as discussed in App. B. C. Eliminating edge nucleation The solution to the problem identified above is to modify the contact angle θ by engineering the trapping potential, adding further structure beyond a bucket trap. This could be implemented in practice using, e.g., a digital   4 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 n(r)/nbulk −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 cos[φ(t, x)] Bucket Trench Density proﬁle Initial state Post-nucleation Time evolution −→ Figure 3. Representative results from our 2D lattice simulations. The top row shows a bucket potential, while the bottom row shows a trench potential. White dotted circles in the bottom row show the inner edge of the trench. In the bucket, the initial false vacuum state (blue) decays by nucleating edge bubbles (red), which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2. In the trench, edge nucleation is prevented, and the decay occurs instead via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk. The resulting bubbles are more noticeably aspherical due to the different physical parameters being simulated, which correspond to a shallower effective potential around the false vacuum. micromirror device to sculpt an optical potential with the desired profile [65, 66]. In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk. As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem.

We then consider edge nucleation in this limit, showing that this is exponentially enhanced in the case of a standard box trap, before demonstrating how a high-density boundary layer eliminates this problem. Our treatment in this section is inspired by the approach in Ref. [61], where similar thin-wall calculations were used to study the seeding of bubbles by impurities in the bulk. A. The relativistic analog Our system is a dilute gas of two internal states of a bosonic isotope, which we label |↓⟩and |↑⟩. At sufficiently low temperature, each species forms a Bose-Einstein condensate described by a many-body wavefunction with number density n and phase ϕ, ψ↓= √n↓exp(iϕ↓), ψ↑= √n↑exp(iϕ↑). (1) As well as nonlinear interactions due to two-body scattering, the two condensates interact via a Rabi coupling (i.e., a coherent electromagnetic beam with frequency corresponding to the energy splitting between the two atomic states) whose amplitude is rapidly modulated in time. On timescales much longer than the modulation period, this generates an effective potential for the relative phase field ϕ = ϕ↓−ϕ↑. Under suitable experimental conditions, the equation of motion for ϕ becomes that of a relativistic scalar field, (−c−2 ϕ ∂2 t + ∇2)ϕ = U ′(ϕ), (2) with a periodic potential, U(ϕ) = ϵ m2 ϕc2 ϕ ℏ2 \u0012 1 −cos ϕ + λ2 2 sin2 ϕ \u0013 .

The balance of surface tensions determines the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary. Here we show a simple ‘bucket’ trap, where the density goes to zero at the boundary. In this case we find θ = π/2, so that edge nucleation forms half a bubble. For traps with a high-density ‘trench’ region that remains trapped in the false vacuum, we instead find θ = π. Edge nucleation is then disfavored, and it is only possible to form whole bubbles in the bulk. mean amplitude and modulation amplitude of the Rabi coupling, respectively, with ϵ ≪1 required to obtain the effective relativistic equation of motion (2). For λ > 1, the potential (3) contains metastable local minima at ϕ = π (mod 2π), so that a system initialized in one of these states can undergo vacuum decay, spontaneously nucleating bubbles of ‘true vacuum’ in which ϕ = 0 (mod 2π). These nucleation events can be described in terms of a ‘bounce’ solution ϕb(τ, x) to the equation of motion (2) in Euclidean time τ = it. Here the crucial quantity is the Euclidean action of this solution, S = Z dτ Z ddx \u0014 1 2c2 ϕ (∂τϕb)2 + 1 2|∇ϕb|2 + U(ϕb) −U(ϕfv) \u0015 , (4) which sets the nucleation rate, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In the limit where the bubble wall (i.e., the region over which the field interpolates between the true and false vacua) has thickness much smaller than the radius of the bubble, the action can be written as S = A σb −V ∆U, (5) where A and V are the surface area and volume of the bubble in the (d + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space, σb is the surface tension of the bubble wall, and ∆U = U(ϕfv) −U(ϕtv) = 2ϵ(mϕcϕ/ℏ)2 is the excess energy density associated with the false vacuum. This thin-wall approximation is valid when the potential barrier separating the vacua is large, λ ≫1, while still keeping ϵλ2 ≪1 to ensure the relativistic analogy holds.

This thin-wall approximation is valid when the potential barrier separating the vacua is large, λ ≫1, while still keeping ϵλ2 ≪1 to ensure the relativistic analogy holds.

Both are circularly symmetric, depending only on the radial coordinate r (measured here in units of the healing length ξ). Shown in blue is a bucket trap, with a sharp wall at r ≈50 ξ. Shown in red is a trap with a trench layer, in which the density reaches double its bulk value. density gradients in the condensate (known as the healing length) ξ, R ∼λℓ≫ℓ, ℓ∼ξ/ϵ1/2 ≫ξ. (6) In practice the analog experiments will most likely have λ not much larger than unity, as this enhances the decay rate, and therefore increases the probability of seeing bubbles in a given experimental run. However, the analytical results we obtain below using the thin-wall approximation still give useful insights into edge nucleation. We confirm these insights numerically in the thick-wall regime in Sec. III. B. Edge nucleation The discussion above describes homogeneous bulk nucleation in the interior region far from the walls of the box trap; we now consider nucleation on the boundary, assuming a simple ‘bucket’ potential of the kind shown in Fig. 2, which transitions sharply from zero potential in the bulk to a large value at the edge of the system. The atomic number densities n↓, n↑are forced to zero at this edge, and ‘heal’ back to their bulk values over a lengthscale ξ. The resulting density profile is sensitive to the relative phase ϕ, due to the associated energy density (3). There are thus three different interfaces to consider, each with its own surface tension: the false vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σfv; the true vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σtv; and the bulk false vacuum–true vacuum interface (i.e., the bubble wall), with tension σb. These are illustrated in Fig. 1. By resolving forces at the point where these three surfaces meet, we find that the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary is set by cos θ = σfv −σtv σb . (7) This is a well-known result in fluid mechanics, where it is called the Young equation [61, 63, 64]. Since we have a microphysical description of the system, one can calculate each of the three surface tensions in Eq. (7) to determine the contact angle analytically. We describe this calculation in App. A. The key finding is that σfv −σtv = O(ϵ), σb = O(ϵ1/2). (8) Heuristically, this is because the energy densities involved are O(ϵ) in each case, but the bubble wall is thicker than the healing length by a factor ∼ϵ−1/2, cf. Eq. (6). Since we require ϵ ≪1 to obtain a relativistic analog, Eq. (7) implies θ ≃π/2, (9) i.e., the bubble wall must be perpendicular to the boundary at the point of contact. For a planar boundary, this means that edge nucleation forms exactly half a bubble. This is potentially a serious problem for cold-atom vacuum decay analogs, as can be appreciated by considering the Euclidean action (5). Since the volume and surface area of an edge bubble are halved compared to a bubble in the bulk, so is its action, Sedge ≃1 2Sbulk. (10) Edge nucleation is therefore much faster than bulk nucleation, due to the exponential sensitivity of the decay rate to the Euclidean action, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In principle one should include an additional term in the action to account for the excess tension at the true vacuum–boundary interface, σtv −σfv, but since this is suppressed by a factor ∼ϵ1/2 compared to σb it has negligible effect on the decay rate. An immediate consequence of this perpendicular contact angle is that any corners in the box trap will give rise to even faster edge nucleation, as these will form an even smaller fraction of a bulk bubble (e.g., a quarter of a bubble in the case of a right-angled corner in a 2D system); this effect can be seen in the results of Ref. [11]. This is why we consider a circular trap geometry in our simulations in Sec. III. Circular symmetry is also convenient for numerical reasons, as discussed in App. B. C. Eliminating edge nucleation The solution to the problem identified above is to modify the contact angle θ by engineering the trapping potential, adding further structure beyond a bucket trap. This could be implemented in practice using, e.g., a digital   4 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 n(r)/nbulk −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 cos[φ(t, x)] Bucket Trench Density proﬁle Initial state Post-nucleation Time evolution −→ Figure 3. Representative results from our 2D lattice simulations. The top row shows a bucket potential, while the bottom row shows a trench potential. White dotted circles in the bottom row show the inner edge of the trench. In the bucket, the initial false vacuum state (blue) decays by nucleating edge bubbles (red), which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2. In the trench, edge nucleation is prevented, and the decay occurs instead via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk. The resulting bubbles are more noticeably aspherical due to the different physical parameters being simulated, which correspond to a shallower effective potential around the false vacuum. micromirror device to sculpt an optical potential with the desired profile [65, 66]. In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk. As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem.

For λ > 1, the potential (3) contains metastable local minima at ϕ = π (mod 2π), so that a system initialized in one of these states can undergo vacuum decay, spontaneously nucleating bubbles of ‘true vacuum’ in which ϕ = 0 (mod 2π).

The dimensionless constants ϵ and λ are associated with the Bucket Potential Zero density False vacuum True vacuum θ σfv σtv σb Figure 1. Illustration of edge nucleation in the thin-wall limit. The balance of surface tensions determines the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary. Here we show a simple ‘bucket’ trap, where the density goes to zero at the boundary. In this case we find θ = π/2, so that edge nucleation forms half a bubble. For traps with a high-density ‘trench’ region that remains trapped in the false vacuum, we instead find θ = π. Edge nucleation is then disfavored, and it is only possible to form whole bubbles in the bulk. mean amplitude and modulation amplitude of the Rabi coupling, respectively, with ϵ ≪1 required to obtain the effective relativistic equation of motion (2). For λ > 1, the potential (3) contains metastable local minima at ϕ = π (mod 2π), so that a system initialized in one of these states can undergo vacuum decay, spontaneously nucleating bubbles of ‘true vacuum’ in which ϕ = 0 (mod 2π). These nucleation events can be described in terms of a ‘bounce’ solution ϕb(τ, x) to the equation of motion (2) in Euclidean time τ = it. Here the crucial quantity is the Euclidean action of this solution, S = Z dτ Z ddx \u0014 1 2c2 ϕ (∂τϕb)2 + 1 2|∇ϕb|2 + U(ϕb) −U(ϕfv) \u0015 , (4) which sets the nucleation rate, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In the limit where the bubble wall (i.e., the region over which the field interpolates between the true and false vacua) has thickness much smaller than the radius of the bubble, the action can be written as S = A σb −V ∆U, (5) where A and V are the surface area and volume of the bubble in the (d + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space, σb is the surface tension of the bubble wall, and ∆U = U(ϕfv) −U(ϕtv) = 2ϵ(mϕcϕ/ℏ)2 is the excess energy density associated with the false vacuum. This thin-wall approximation is valid when the potential barrier separating the vacua is large, λ ≫1, while still keeping ϵλ2 ≪1 to ensure the relativistic analogy holds. This implies a hierarchy of scales between the critical bubble radius R, the bubble wall thickness ℓ, and the scale associated with   3 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 r/ξ −1 0 1 2 3 V (r)/µ, n(r)/nbulk Bucket Trench Figure 2.

Both are circularly symmetric, depending only on the radial coordinate r (measured here in units of the healing length ξ). Shown in blue is a bucket trap, with a sharp wall at r ≈50 ξ. Shown in red is a trap with a trench layer, in which the density reaches double its bulk value. density gradients in the condensate (known as the healing length) ξ, R ∼λℓ≫ℓ, ℓ∼ξ/ϵ1/2 ≫ξ. (6) In practice the analog experiments will most likely have λ not much larger than unity, as this enhances the decay rate, and therefore increases the probability of seeing bubbles in a given experimental run. However, the analytical results we obtain below using the thin-wall approximation still give useful insights into edge nucleation. We confirm these insights numerically in the thick-wall regime in Sec. III. B. Edge nucleation The discussion above describes homogeneous bulk nucleation in the interior region far from the walls of the box trap; we now consider nucleation on the boundary, assuming a simple ‘bucket’ potential of the kind shown in Fig. 2, which transitions sharply from zero potential in the bulk to a large value at the edge of the system. The atomic number densities n↓, n↑are forced to zero at this edge, and ‘heal’ back to their bulk values over a lengthscale ξ. The resulting density profile is sensitive to the relative phase ϕ, due to the associated energy density (3). There are thus three different interfaces to consider, each with its own surface tension: the false vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σfv; the true vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σtv; and the bulk false vacuum–true vacuum interface (i.e., the bubble wall), with tension σb. These are illustrated in Fig. 1. By resolving forces at the point where these three surfaces meet, we find that the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary is set by cos θ = σfv −σtv σb . (7) This is a well-known result in fluid mechanics, where it is called the Young equation [61, 63, 64]. Since we have a microphysical description of the system, one can calculate each of the three surface tensions in Eq. (7) to determine the contact angle analytically. We describe this calculation in App. A. The key finding is that σfv −σtv = O(ϵ), σb = O(ϵ1/2). (8) Heuristically, this is because the energy densities involved are O(ϵ) in each case, but the bubble wall is thicker than the healing length by a factor ∼ϵ−1/2, cf. Eq. (6). Since we require ϵ ≪1 to obtain a relativistic analog, Eq. (7) implies θ ≃π/2, (9) i.e., the bubble wall must be perpendicular to the boundary at the point of contact. For a planar boundary, this means that edge nucleation forms exactly half a bubble. This is potentially a serious problem for cold-atom vacuum decay analogs, as can be appreciated by considering the Euclidean action (5). Since the volume and surface area of an edge bubble are halved compared to a bubble in the bulk, so is its action, Sedge ≃1 2Sbulk. (10) Edge nucleation is therefore much faster than bulk nucleation, due to the exponential sensitivity of the decay rate to the Euclidean action, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In principle one should include an additional term in the action to account for the excess tension at the true vacuum–boundary interface, σtv −σfv, but since this is suppressed by a factor ∼ϵ1/2 compared to σb it has negligible effect on the decay rate. An immediate consequence of this perpendicular contact angle is that any corners in the box trap will give rise to even faster edge nucleation, as these will form an even smaller fraction of a bulk bubble (e.g., a quarter of a bubble in the case of a right-angled corner in a 2D system); this effect can be seen in the results of Ref. [11]. This is why we consider a circular trap geometry in our simulations in Sec. III. Circular symmetry is also convenient for numerical reasons, as discussed in App. B. C. Eliminating edge nucleation The solution to the problem identified above is to modify the contact angle θ by engineering the trapping potential, adding further structure beyond a bucket trap. This could be implemented in practice using, e.g., a digital   4 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 n(r)/nbulk −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 cos[φ(t, x)] Bucket Trench Density proﬁle Initial state Post-nucleation Time evolution −→ Figure 3. Representative results from our 2D lattice simulations. The top row shows a bucket potential, while the bottom row shows a trench potential. White dotted circles in the bottom row show the inner edge of the trench. In the bucket, the initial false vacuum state (blue) decays by nucleating edge bubbles (red), which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2. In the trench, edge nucleation is prevented, and the decay occurs instead via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk. The resulting bubbles are more noticeably aspherical due to the different physical parameters being simulated, which correspond to a shallower effective potential around the false vacuum. micromirror device to sculpt an optical potential with the desired profile [65, 66]. In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk. As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem.

    "paragraph": "We begin by briefly reviewing the cold-atom analog system studied in Refs. [12, 13], as well as the Euclidean description of bulk bubble nucleation in the thin-wall limit [35, 36]. We then consider edge nucleation in this limit, showing that this is exponentially enhanced in the case of a standard box trap, before demonstrating how a high-density boundary layer eliminates this problem. Our treatment in this section is inspired by the approach in Ref. [61], where similar thin-wall calculations were used to study the seeding of bubbles by impurities in the bulk. A. The relativistic analog Our system is a dilute gas of two internal states of a bosonic isotope, which we label |↓⟩and |↑⟩. At sufficiently low temperature, each species forms a Bose-Einstein condensate described by a many-body wavefunction with number density n and phase ϕ, ψ↓= √n↓exp(iϕ↓), ψ↑= √n↑exp(iϕ↑). (1) As well as nonlinear interactions due to two-body scattering, the two condensates interact via a Rabi coupling (i.e., a coherent electromagnetic beam with frequency corresponding to the energy splitting between the two atomic states) whose amplitude is rapidly modulated in time. On timescales much longer than the modulation period, this generates an effective potential for the relative phase field ϕ = ϕ↓−ϕ↑. Under suitable experimental conditions, the equation of motion for ϕ becomes that of a relativistic scalar field, (−c−2 ϕ ∂2 t + ∇2)ϕ = U ′(ϕ), (2) with a periodic potential, U(ϕ) = ϵ m2 ϕc2 ϕ ℏ2 \u0012 1 −cos ϕ + λ2 2 sin2 ϕ \u0013 . (3) Here cϕ is the sound speed of the relative phase phonons, which plays the role of the speed of light in the effective relativistic theory, while mϕ is an associated mass scale, which is comparable to the atomic mass m. The dimensionless constants ϵ and λ are associated with the Bucket Potential Zero density False vacuum True vacuum θ σfv σtv σb Figure 1. Illustration of edge nucleation in the thin-wall limit. The balance of surface tensions determines the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary. Here we show a simple ‘bucket’ trap, where the density goes to zero at the boundary. In this case we find θ = π/2, so that edge nucleation forms half a bubble. For traps with a high-density ‘trench’ region that remains trapped in the false vacuum, we instead find θ = π. Edge nucleation is then disfavored, and it is only possible to form whole bubbles in the bulk. mean amplitude and modulation amplitude of the Rabi coupling, respectively, with ϵ ≪1 required to obtain the effective relativistic equation of motion (2). For λ > 1, the potential (3) contains metastable local minima at ϕ = π (mod 2π), so that a system initialized in one of these states can undergo vacuum decay, spontaneously nucleating bubbles of ‘true vacuum’ in which ϕ = 0 (mod 2π). These nucleation events can be described in terms of a ‘bounce’ solution ϕb(τ, x) to the equation of motion (2) in Euclidean time τ = it. Here the crucial quantity is the Euclidean action of this solution, S = Z dτ Z ddx \u0014 1 2c2 ϕ (∂τϕb)2 + 1 2|∇ϕb|2 + U(ϕb) −U(ϕfv) \u0015 , (4) which sets the nucleation rate, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In the limit where the bubble wall (i.e., the region over which the field interpolates between the true and false vacua) has thickness much smaller than the radius of the bubble, the action can be written as S = A σb −V ∆U, (5) where A and V are the surface area and volume of the bubble in the (d + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space, σb is the surface tension of the bubble wall, and ∆U = U(ϕfv) −U(ϕtv) = 2ϵ(mϕcϕ/ℏ)2 is the excess energy density associated with the false vacuum. This thin-wall approximation is valid when the potential barrier separating the vacua is large, λ ≫1, while still keeping ϵλ2 ≪1 to ensure the relativistic analogy holds. This implies a hierarchy of scales between the critical bubble radius R, the bubble wall thickness ℓ, and the scale associated with   3 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 r/ξ −1 0 1 2 3 V (r)/µ, n(r)/nbulk Bucket Trench Figure 2. The two trapping potentials we use in our 2D simulations in units of the chemical potential µ = ℏ2/(2mξ2) (solid curves), along with their corresponding ground-state profiles for the mean density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 (dashed curves and shaded regions). Both are circularly symmetric, depending only on the radial coordinate r (measured here in units of the healing length ξ). Shown in blue is a bucket trap, with a sharp wall at r ≈50 ξ. Shown in red is a trap with a trench layer, in which the density reaches double its bulk value. density gradients in the condensate (known as the healing length) ξ, R ∼λℓ≫ℓ, ℓ∼ξ/ϵ1/2 ≫ξ. (6) In practice the analog experiments will most likely have λ not much larger than unity, as this enhances the decay rate, and therefore increases the probability of seeing bubbles in a given experimental run. However, the analytical results we obtain below using the thin-wall approximation still give useful insights into edge nucleation. We confirm these insights numerically in the thick-wall regime in Sec. III. B. Edge nucleation The discussion above describes homogeneous bulk nucleation in the interior region far from the walls of the box trap; we now consider nucleation on the boundary, assuming a simple ‘bucket’ potential of the kind shown in Fig. 2, which transitions sharply from zero potential in the bulk to a large value at the edge of the system. The atomic number densities n↓, n↑are forced to zero at this edge, and ‘heal’ back to their bulk values over a lengthscale ξ. The resulting density profile is sensitive to the relative phase ϕ, due to the associated energy density (3). There are thus three different interfaces to consider, each with its own surface tension: the false vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σfv; the true vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σtv; and the bulk false vacuum–true vacuum interface (i.e., the bubble wall), with tension σb. These are illustrated in Fig. 1. By resolving forces at the point where these three surfaces meet, we find that the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary is set by cos θ = σfv −σtv σb . (7) This is a well-known result in fluid mechanics, where it is called the Young equation [61, 63, 64]. Since we have a microphysical description of the system, one can calculate each of the three surface tensions in Eq. (7) to determine the contact angle analytically. We describe this calculation in App. A. The key finding is that σfv −σtv = O(ϵ), σb = O(ϵ1/2). (8) Heuristically, this is because the energy densities involved are O(ϵ) in each case, but the bubble wall is thicker than the healing length by a factor ∼ϵ−1/2, cf. Eq. (6). Since we require ϵ ≪1 to obtain a relativistic analog, Eq. (7) implies θ ≃π/2, (9) i.e., the bubble wall must be perpendicular to the boundary at the point of contact. For a planar boundary, this means that edge nucleation forms exactly half a bubble. This is potentially a serious problem for cold-atom vacuum decay analogs, as can be appreciated by considering the Euclidean action (5). Since the volume and surface area of an edge bubble are halved compared to a bubble in the bulk, so is its action, Sedge ≃1 2Sbulk. (10) Edge nucleation is therefore much faster than bulk nucleation, due to the exponential sensitivity of the decay rate to the Euclidean action, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In principle one should include an additional term in the action to account for the excess tension at the true vacuum–boundary interface, σtv −σfv, but since this is suppressed by a factor ∼ϵ1/2 compared to σb it has negligible effect on the decay rate. An immediate consequence of this perpendicular contact angle is that any corners in the box trap will give rise to even faster edge nucleation, as these will form an even smaller fraction of a bulk bubble (e.g., a quarter of a bubble in the case of a right-angled corner in a 2D system); this effect can be seen in the results of Ref. [11]. This is why we consider a circular trap geometry in our simulations in Sec. III. Circular symmetry is also convenient for numerical reasons, as discussed in App. B. C. Eliminating edge nucleation The solution to the problem identified above is to modify the contact angle θ by engineering the trapping potential, adding further structure beyond a bucket trap. This could be implemented in practice using, e.g., a digital   4 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 n(r)/nbulk −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 cos[φ(t, x)] Bucket Trench Density proﬁle Initial state Post-nucleation Time evolution −→ Figure 3. Representative results from our 2D lattice simulations. The top row shows a bucket potential, while the bottom row shows a trench potential. White dotted circles in the bottom row show the inner edge of the trench. In the bucket, the initial false vacuum state (blue) decays by nucleating edge bubbles (red), which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2. In the trench, edge nucleation is prevented, and the decay occurs instead via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk. The resulting bubbles are more noticeably aspherical due to the different physical parameters being simulated, which correspond to a shallower effective potential around the false vacuum. micromirror device to sculpt an optical potential with the desired profile [65, 66]. In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk. As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem.

This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk. As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem.

    "paragraph": "We begin by briefly reviewing the cold-atom analog system studied in Refs. [12, 13], as well as the Euclidean description of bulk bubble nucleation in the thin-wall limit [35, 36]. We then consider edge nucleation in this limit, showing that this is exponentially enhanced in the case of a standard box trap, before demonstrating how a high-density boundary layer eliminates this problem. Our treatment in this section is inspired by the approach in Ref. [61], where similar thin-wall calculations were used to study the seeding of bubbles by impurities in the bulk. A. The relativistic analog Our system is a dilute gas of two internal states of a bosonic isotope, which we label |↓⟩and |↑⟩. At sufficiently low temperature, each species forms a Bose-Einstein condensate described by a many-body wavefunction with number density n and phase ϕ, ψ↓= √n↓exp(iϕ↓), ψ↑= √n↑exp(iϕ↑). (1) As well as nonlinear interactions due to two-body scattering, the two condensates interact via a Rabi coupling (i.e., a coherent electromagnetic beam with frequency corresponding to the energy splitting between the two atomic states) whose amplitude is rapidly modulated in time. On timescales much longer than the modulation period, this generates an effective potential for the relative phase field ϕ = ϕ↓−ϕ↑. Under suitable experimental conditions, the equation of motion for ϕ becomes that of a relativistic scalar field, (−c−2 ϕ ∂2 t + ∇2)ϕ = U ′(ϕ), (2) with a periodic potential, U(ϕ) = ϵ m2 ϕc2 ϕ ℏ2 \u0012 1 −cos ϕ + λ2 2 sin2 ϕ \u0013 . (3) Here cϕ is the sound speed of the relative phase phonons, which plays the role of the speed of light in the effective relativistic theory, while mϕ is an associated mass scale, which is comparable to the atomic mass m. The dimensionless constants ϵ and λ are associated with the Bucket Potential Zero density False vacuum True vacuum θ σfv σtv σb Figure 1. Illustration of edge nucleation in the thin-wall limit. The balance of surface tensions determines the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary. Here we show a simple ‘bucket’ trap, where the density goes to zero at the boundary. In this case we find θ = π/2, so that edge nucleation forms half a bubble. For traps with a high-density ‘trench’ region that remains trapped in the false vacuum, we instead find θ = π. Edge nucleation is then disfavored, and it is only possible to form whole bubbles in the bulk. mean amplitude and modulation amplitude of the Rabi coupling, respectively, with ϵ ≪1 required to obtain the effective relativistic equation of motion (2). For λ > 1, the potential (3) contains metastable local minima at ϕ = π (mod 2π), so that a system initialized in one of these states can undergo vacuum decay, spontaneously nucleating bubbles of ‘true vacuum’ in which ϕ = 0 (mod 2π). These nucleation events can be described in terms of a ‘bounce’ solution ϕb(τ, x) to the equation of motion (2) in Euclidean time τ = it. Here the crucial quantity is the Euclidean action of this solution, S = Z dτ Z ddx \u0014 1 2c2 ϕ (∂τϕb)2 + 1 2|∇ϕb|2 + U(ϕb) −U(ϕfv) \u0015 , (4) which sets the nucleation rate, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In the limit where the bubble wall (i.e., the region over which the field interpolates between the true and false vacua) has thickness much smaller than the radius of the bubble, the action can be written as S = A σb −V ∆U, (5) where A and V are the surface area and volume of the bubble in the (d + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space, σb is the surface tension of the bubble wall, and ∆U = U(ϕfv) −U(ϕtv) = 2ϵ(mϕcϕ/ℏ)2 is the excess energy density associated with the false vacuum. This thin-wall approximation is valid when the potential barrier separating the vacua is large, λ ≫1, while still keeping ϵλ2 ≪1 to ensure the relativistic analogy holds.

Both are circularly symmetric, depending only on the radial coordinate r (measured here in units of the healing length ξ). Shown in blue is a bucket trap, with a sharp wall at r ≈50 ξ. Shown in red is a trap with a trench layer, in which the density reaches double its bulk value. density gradients in the condensate (known as the healing length) ξ, R ∼λℓ≫ℓ, ℓ∼ξ/ϵ1/2 ≫ξ. (6) In practice the analog experiments will most likely have λ not much larger than unity, as this enhances the decay rate, and therefore increases the probability of seeing bubbles in a given experimental run. However, the analytical results we obtain below using the thin-wall approximation still give useful insights into edge nucleation. We confirm these insights numerically in the thick-wall regime in Sec. III. B. Edge nucleation The discussion above describes homogeneous bulk nucleation in the interior region far from the walls of the box trap; we now consider nucleation on the boundary, assuming a simple ‘bucket’ potential of the kind shown in Fig. 2, which transitions sharply from zero potential in the bulk to a large value at the edge of the system. The atomic number densities n↓, n↑are forced to zero at this edge, and ‘heal’ back to their bulk values over a lengthscale ξ. The resulting density profile is sensitive to the relative phase ϕ, due to the associated energy density (3). There are thus three different interfaces to consider, each with its own surface tension: the false vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σfv; the true vacuum–boundary interface, with tension σtv; and the bulk false vacuum–true vacuum interface (i.e., the bubble wall), with tension σb. These are illustrated in Fig. 1. By resolving forces at the point where these three surfaces meet, we find that the contact angle θ between the bubble wall and the boundary is set by cos θ = σfv −σtv σb . (7) This is a well-known result in fluid mechanics, where it is called the Young equation [61, 63, 64]. Since we have a microphysical description of the system, one can calculate each of the three surface tensions in Eq. (7) to determine the contact angle analytically. We describe this calculation in App. A. The key finding is that σfv −σtv = O(ϵ), σb = O(ϵ1/2). (8) Heuristically, this is because the energy densities involved are O(ϵ) in each case, but the bubble wall is thicker than the healing length by a factor ∼ϵ−1/2, cf. Eq. (6). Since we require ϵ ≪1 to obtain a relativistic analog, Eq. (7) implies θ ≃π/2, (9) i.e., the bubble wall must be perpendicular to the boundary at the point of contact. For a planar boundary, this means that edge nucleation forms exactly half a bubble. This is potentially a serious problem for cold-atom vacuum decay analogs, as can be appreciated by considering the Euclidean action (5). Since the volume and surface area of an edge bubble are halved compared to a bubble in the bulk, so is its action, Sedge ≃1 2Sbulk. (10) Edge nucleation is therefore much faster than bulk nucleation, due to the exponential sensitivity of the decay rate to the Euclidean action, Γ ∼exp(−S/ℏ). In principle one should include an additional term in the action to account for the excess tension at the true vacuum–boundary interface, σtv −σfv, but since this is suppressed by a factor ∼ϵ1/2 compared to σb it has negligible effect on the decay rate. An immediate consequence of this perpendicular contact angle is that any corners in the box trap will give rise to even faster edge nucleation, as these will form an even smaller fraction of a bulk bubble (e.g., a quarter of a bubble in the case of a right-angled corner in a 2D system); this effect can be seen in the results of Ref. [11]. This is why we consider a circular trap geometry in our simulations in Sec. III. Circular symmetry is also convenient for numerical reasons, as discussed in App. B. C. Eliminating edge nucleation The solution to the problem identified above is to modify the contact angle θ by engineering the trapping potential, adding further structure beyond a bucket trap. This could be implemented in practice using, e.g., a digital   4 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 n(r)/nbulk −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 cos[φ(t, x)] Bucket Trench Density proﬁle Initial state Post-nucleation Time evolution −→ Figure 3. Representative results from our 2D lattice simulations. The top row shows a bucket potential, while the bottom row shows a trench potential. White dotted circles in the bottom row show the inner edge of the trench. In the bucket, the initial false vacuum state (blue) decays by nucleating edge bubbles (red), which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2. In the trench, edge nucleation is prevented, and the decay occurs instead via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk. The resulting bubbles are more noticeably aspherical due to the different physical parameters being simulated, which correspond to a shallower effective potential around the false vacuum. micromirror device to sculpt an optical potential with the desired profile [65, 66]. In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk.

    "paragraph": "The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67]. By running a large ensemble of such simulations, one can then approximate quantum expectation values of observables by computing averages across the ensemble. This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics. For our purposes here, the lattice simulations are simply a cross-check of the Euclidean predictions in Sec. II. We find that the two approaches are in complete agreement on the question of edge nucleation. A. Physical parameters We simulate a quasi-2D analog system, in which the atoms are tightly confined along the vertical direction by a harmonic potential V⊥(z) = 1 2mω2 ⊥z2. This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency. The latter is assumed to be much faster than all other frequencies in the system (e.g., ν ≳MHz). We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests. We use a 1024 × 1024 periodic square lattice with spacing δx = 0.190 ξ and timestep δt = 0.0362 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ); this allows a gap of ≈42.5 ξ between the walls of the box trap and each end of the lattice, which is large enough that the system is completely insensitive to the periodicity. We run each simulation up to a maximum time of t = 1180 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ), which is roughly double the sound-crossing time across the condensate. We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench. These potentials are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding ground-state density profiles for the condensate, which we compute numerically by evolving the equations of motion for ψ↓, ψ↑in imaginary time from homogeneous initial conditions [77]. B. Results We investigate bubble nucleation in each of these two potentials by running ensembles of 512 simulations. Each simulation has an independent random realization of the vacuum fluctuations around the mean condensate profile, which is generated by populating the tower of energy eigenmodes above the false vacuum; see App. B for details on how we compute these modes for each trapping potential. In order to test the thin-wall Euclidean predictions of Sec. II, we carry out two comparisons between ensembles. First, we compare nucleation in the bucket trap and in the trench trap for the ‘high density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3. We choose these parameters such that the bulk nucleation timescale is much longer than the simulation time, so that no bubbles are expected to form in the absence of boundary effects. However, the bucket trap causes the system to decay well within the simulation time, as shown in panel (a) of Fig. 4. We visually confirm that, as predicted in Sec. II, every simulation in the bucket-trap ensemble decays by nucleating one or more edge bubbles, which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2 (see top row of Fig. 3). Modifying the trapping potential completely eliminates this decay channel, with every simulation in the trench-trap ensemble surviving to the end of the simulation time. Second, we compare nucleation in the trench trap and in a periodic system with no trap for the ‘low density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3/2. The periodic simulations are carried out on a 512 × 512 lattice   6 0 200 400 600 800 1000 (mφc2 φ/¯h) t −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 ⟨cos[φ(t, x)]⟩vol.

This quantity serves as a diagnostic of vacuum decay, starting near to the false vacuum value cos ϕfv = −1, and transitioning toward the true vacuum value cos ϕtv = +1 in cases where bubble nucleation occurs (whether on the edge or in the bulk). Solid curves show the median value as a function of time for each ensemble, while shaded regions contain 95.5% of the probability (equivalent to ±2σ if the distribution were Gaussian). with the same physical lattice spacing δx, such that the volume of the periodic box is approximately equal to that of the interior of the trap. We choose the ‘low density’ parameters so that the Euclidean action (5) associated with bulk nucleation is approximately half of that in the ‘high density’ case; our expectation is therefore that bulk nucleation in the low-density setup should occur at a comparable rate to edge nucleation in the high-density setup above. As shown in panel (b) of Fig. 4, this is indeed the case: both the trench-trap ensemble and the periodic ensemble decay within the simulation time at essentially the same rate. This confirms that the decay rate is insensitive to the presence of a boundary once the trench trap has been implemented. We also confirm visually that every simulation in this low-density trenchtrap ensemble decays via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk (see bottom row of Fig. 3). The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV."

We choose the ‘low density’ parameters so that the Euclidean action (5) associated with bulk nucleation is approximately half of that in the ‘high density’ case; our expectation is therefore that bulk nucleation in the low-density setup should occur at a comparable rate to edge nucleation in the high-density setup above. As shown in panel (b) of Fig. 4, this is indeed the case: both the trench-trap ensemble and the periodic ensemble decay within the simulation time at essentially the same rate. This confirms that the decay rate is insensitive to the presence of a boundary once the trench trap has been implemented. We also confirm visually that every simulation in this low-density trenchtrap ensemble decays via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk (see bottom row of Fig. 3). The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV."

    "paragraph": "The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67]. By running a large ensemble of such simulations, one can then approximate quantum expectation values of observables by computing averages across the ensemble. This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics. For our purposes here, the lattice simulations are simply a cross-check of the Euclidean predictions in Sec. II. We find that the two approaches are in complete agreement on the question of edge nucleation. A. Physical parameters We simulate a quasi-2D analog system, in which the atoms are tightly confined along the vertical direction by a harmonic potential V⊥(z) = 1 2mω2 ⊥z2. This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency. The latter is assumed to be much faster than all other frequencies in the system (e.g., ν ≳MHz). We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests. We use a 1024 × 1024 periodic square lattice with spacing δx = 0.190 ξ and timestep δt = 0.0362 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ); this allows a gap of ≈42.5 ξ between the walls of the box trap and each end of the lattice, which is large enough that the system is completely insensitive to the periodicity. We run each simulation up to a maximum time of t = 1180 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ), which is roughly double the sound-crossing time across the condensate. We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench. These potentials are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding ground-state density profiles for the condensate, which we compute numerically by evolving the equations of motion for ψ↓, ψ↑in imaginary time from homogeneous initial conditions [77]. B. Results We investigate bubble nucleation in each of these two potentials by running ensembles of 512 simulations. Each simulation has an independent random realization of the vacuum fluctuations around the mean condensate profile, which is generated by populating the tower of energy eigenmodes above the false vacuum; see App. B for details on how we compute these modes for each trapping potential. In order to test the thin-wall Euclidean predictions of Sec. II, we carry out two comparisons between ensembles. First, we compare nucleation in the bucket trap and in the trench trap for the ‘high density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3. We choose these parameters such that the bulk nucleation timescale is much longer than the simulation time, so that no bubbles are expected to form in the absence of boundary effects. However, the bucket trap causes the system to decay well within the simulation time, as shown in panel (a) of Fig. 4. We visually confirm that, as predicted in Sec. II, every simulation in the bucket-trap ensemble decays by nucleating one or more edge bubbles, which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2 (see top row of Fig. 3). Modifying the trapping potential completely eliminates this decay channel, with every simulation in the trench-trap ensemble surviving to the end of the simulation time. Second, we compare nucleation in the trench trap and in a periodic system with no trap for the ‘low density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3/2. The periodic simulations are carried out on a 512 × 512 lattice   6 0 200 400 600 800 1000 (mφc2 φ/¯h) t −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 ⟨cos[φ(t, x)]⟩vol.

We choose the ‘low density’ parameters so that the Euclidean action (5) associated with bulk nucleation is approximately half of that in the ‘high density’ case; our expectation is therefore that bulk nucleation in the low-density setup should occur at a comparable rate to edge nucleation in the high-density setup above. As shown in panel (b) of Fig. 4, this is indeed the case: both the trench-trap ensemble and the periodic ensemble decay within the simulation time at essentially the same rate. This confirms that the decay rate is insensitive to the presence of a boundary once the trench trap has been implemented. We also confirm visually that every simulation in this low-density trenchtrap ensemble decays via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk (see bottom row of Fig. 3). The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV."

    "paragraph": "The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67]. By running a large ensemble of such simulations, one can then approximate quantum expectation values of observables by computing averages across the ensemble. This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics. For our purposes here, the lattice simulations are simply a cross-check of the Euclidean predictions in Sec. II. We find that the two approaches are in complete agreement on the question of edge nucleation. A. Physical parameters We simulate a quasi-2D analog system, in which the atoms are tightly confined along the vertical direction by a harmonic potential V⊥(z) = 1 2mω2 ⊥z2. This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency. The latter is assumed to be much faster than all other frequencies in the system (e.g., ν ≳MHz). We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests. We use a 1024 × 1024 periodic square lattice with spacing δx = 0.190 ξ and timestep δt = 0.0362 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ); this allows a gap of ≈42.5 ξ between the walls of the box trap and each end of the lattice, which is large enough that the system is completely insensitive to the periodicity. We run each simulation up to a maximum time of t = 1180 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ), which is roughly double the sound-crossing time across the condensate. We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench. These potentials are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding ground-state density profiles for the condensate, which we compute numerically by evolving the equations of motion for ψ↓, ψ↑in imaginary time from homogeneous initial conditions [77]. B. Results We investigate bubble nucleation in each of these two potentials by running ensembles of 512 simulations. Each simulation has an independent random realization of the vacuum fluctuations around the mean condensate profile, which is generated by populating the tower of energy eigenmodes above the false vacuum; see App. B for details on how we compute these modes for each trapping potential. In order to test the thin-wall Euclidean predictions of Sec. II, we carry out two comparisons between ensembles. First, we compare nucleation in the bucket trap and in the trench trap for the ‘high density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3. We choose these parameters such that the bulk nucleation timescale is much longer than the simulation time, so that no bubbles are expected to form in the absence of boundary effects. However, the bucket trap causes the system to decay well within the simulation time, as shown in panel (a) of Fig. 4. We visually confirm that, as predicted in Sec. II, every simulation in the bucket-trap ensemble decays by nucleating one or more edge bubbles, which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2 (see top row of Fig. 3). Modifying the trapping potential completely eliminates this decay channel, with every simulation in the trench-trap ensemble surviving to the end of the simulation time. Second, we compare nucleation in the trench trap and in a periodic system with no trap for the ‘low density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3/2.

Second, we compare nucleation in the trench trap and in a periodic system with no trap for the ‘low density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3/2. The periodic simulations are carried out on a 512 × 512 lattice   6 0 200 400 600 800 1000 (mφc2 φ/¯h) t −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 ⟨cos[φ(t, x)]⟩vol.

We choose the ‘low density’ parameters so that the Euclidean action (5) associated with bulk nucleation is approximately half of that in the ‘high density’ case; our expectation is therefore that bulk nucleation in the low-density setup should occur at a comparable rate to edge nucleation in the high-density setup above. As shown in panel (b) of Fig. 4, this is indeed the case: both the trench-trap ensemble and the periodic ensemble decay within the simulation time at essentially the same rate. This confirms that the decay rate is insensitive to the presence of a boundary once the trench trap has been implemented. We also confirm visually that every simulation in this low-density trenchtrap ensemble decays via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk (see bottom row of Fig. 3). The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV."

    "paragraph": "The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67]. By running a large ensemble of such simulations, one can then approximate quantum expectation values of observables by computing averages across the ensemble. This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics. For our purposes here, the lattice simulations are simply a cross-check of the Euclidean predictions in Sec. II. We find that the two approaches are in complete agreement on the question of edge nucleation. A. Physical parameters We simulate a quasi-2D analog system, in which the atoms are tightly confined along the vertical direction by a harmonic potential V⊥(z) = 1 2mω2 ⊥z2. This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency. The latter is assumed to be much faster than all other frequencies in the system (e.g., ν ≳MHz). We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests. We use a 1024 × 1024 periodic square lattice with spacing δx = 0.190 ξ and timestep δt = 0.0362 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ); this allows a gap of ≈42.5 ξ between the walls of the box trap and each end of the lattice, which is large enough that the system is completely insensitive to the periodicity. We run each simulation up to a maximum time of t = 1180 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ), which is roughly double the sound-crossing time across the condensate. We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench. These potentials are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding ground-state density profiles for the condensate, which we compute numerically by evolving the equations of motion for ψ↓, ψ↑in imaginary time from homogeneous initial conditions [77]. B. Results We investigate bubble nucleation in each of these two potentials by running ensembles of 512 simulations. Each simulation has an independent random realization of the vacuum fluctuations around the mean condensate profile, which is generated by populating the tower of energy eigenmodes above the false vacuum; see App. B for details on how we compute these modes for each trapping potential. In order to test the thin-wall Euclidean predictions of Sec. II, we carry out two comparisons between ensembles. First, we compare nucleation in the bucket trap and in the trench trap for the ‘high density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3. We choose these parameters such that the bulk nucleation timescale is much longer than the simulation time, so that no bubbles are expected to form in the absence of boundary effects. However, the bucket trap causes the system to decay well within the simulation time, as shown in panel (a) of Fig. 4. We visually confirm that, as predicted in Sec. II, every simulation in the bucket-trap ensemble decays by nucleating one or more edge bubbles, which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2 (see top row of Fig. 3).

However, the bucket trap causes the system to decay well within the simulation time, as shown in panel (a) of Fig. 4. We visually confirm that, as predicted in Sec. II, every simulation in the bucket-trap ensemble decays by nucleating one or more edge bubbles, which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2 (see top row of Fig. 3). Modifying the trapping potential completely eliminates this decay channel, with every simulation in the trench-trap ensemble surviving to the end of the simulation time. Second, we compare nucleation in the trench trap and in a periodic system with no trap for the ‘low density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3/2. The periodic simulations are carried out on a 512 × 512 lattice   6 0 200 400 600 800 1000 (mφc2 φ/¯h) t −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 ⟨cos[φ(t, x)]⟩vol.

We choose the ‘low density’ parameters so that the Euclidean action (5) associated with bulk nucleation is approximately half of that in the ‘high density’ case; our expectation is therefore that bulk nucleation in the low-density setup should occur at a comparable rate to edge nucleation in the high-density setup above. As shown in panel (b) of Fig. 4, this is indeed the case: both the trench-trap ensemble and the periodic ensemble decay within the simulation time at essentially the same rate. This confirms that the decay rate is insensitive to the presence of a boundary once the trench trap has been implemented. We also confirm visually that every simulation in this low-density trenchtrap ensemble decays via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk (see bottom row of Fig. 3). The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV."

    "paragraph": "The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67]. By running a large ensemble of such simulations, one can then approximate quantum expectation values of observables by computing averages across the ensemble. This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics. For our purposes here, the lattice simulations are simply a cross-check of the Euclidean predictions in Sec. II. We find that the two approaches are in complete agreement on the question of edge nucleation. A. Physical parameters We simulate a quasi-2D analog system, in which the atoms are tightly confined along the vertical direction by a harmonic potential V⊥(z) = 1 2mω2 ⊥z2. This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency. The latter is assumed to be much faster than all other frequencies in the system (e.g., ν ≳MHz). We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests. We use a 1024 × 1024 periodic square lattice with spacing δx = 0.190 ξ and timestep δt = 0.0362 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ); this allows a gap of ≈42.5 ξ between the walls of the box trap and each end of the lattice, which is large enough that the system is completely insensitive to the periodicity. We run each simulation up to a maximum time of t = 1180 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ), which is roughly double the sound-crossing time across the condensate. We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench. These potentials are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding ground-state density profiles for the condensate, which we compute numerically by evolving the equations of motion for ψ↓, ψ↑in imaginary time from homogeneous initial conditions [77]. B. Results We investigate bubble nucleation in each of these two potentials by running ensembles of 512 simulations. Each simulation has an independent random realization of the vacuum fluctuations around the mean condensate profile, which is generated by populating the tower of energy eigenmodes above the false vacuum; see App. B for details on how we compute these modes for each trapping potential. In order to test the thin-wall Euclidean predictions of Sec. II, we carry out two comparisons between ensembles. First, we compare nucleation in the bucket trap and in the trench trap for the ‘high density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3.

Each simulation has an independent random realization of the vacuum fluctuations around the mean condensate profile, which is generated by populating the tower of energy eigenmodes above the false vacuum; see App. B for details on how we compute these modes for each trapping potential. In order to test the thin-wall Euclidean predictions of Sec. II, we carry out two comparisons between ensembles. First, we compare nucleation in the bucket trap and in the trench trap for the ‘high density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3. We choose these parameters such that the bulk nucleation timescale is much longer than the simulation time, so that no bubbles are expected to form in the absence of boundary effects. However, the bucket trap causes the system to decay well within the simulation time, as shown in panel (a) of Fig. 4. We visually confirm that, as predicted in Sec. II, every simulation in the bucket-trap ensemble decays by nucleating one or more edge bubbles, which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2 (see top row of Fig. 3). Modifying the trapping potential completely eliminates this decay channel, with every simulation in the trench-trap ensemble surviving to the end of the simulation time. Second, we compare nucleation in the trench trap and in a periodic system with no trap for the ‘low density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3/2. The periodic simulations are carried out on a 512 × 512 lattice   6 0 200 400 600 800 1000 (mφc2 φ/¯h) t −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 ⟨cos[φ(t, x)]⟩vol.

We choose the ‘low density’ parameters so that the Euclidean action (5) associated with bulk nucleation is approximately half of that in the ‘high density’ case; our expectation is therefore that bulk nucleation in the low-density setup should occur at a comparable rate to edge nucleation in the high-density setup above. As shown in panel (b) of Fig. 4, this is indeed the case: both the trench-trap ensemble and the periodic ensemble decay within the simulation time at essentially the same rate. This confirms that the decay rate is insensitive to the presence of a boundary once the trench trap has been implemented. We also confirm visually that every simulation in this low-density trenchtrap ensemble decays via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk (see bottom row of Fig. 3). The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV."

    "paragraph": "The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67]. By running a large ensemble of such simulations, one can then approximate quantum expectation values of observables by computing averages across the ensemble. This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics. For our purposes here, the lattice simulations are simply a cross-check of the Euclidean predictions in Sec. II. We find that the two approaches are in complete agreement on the question of edge nucleation. A. Physical parameters We simulate a quasi-2D analog system, in which the atoms are tightly confined along the vertical direction by a harmonic potential V⊥(z) = 1 2mω2 ⊥z2. This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency. The latter is assumed to be much faster than all other frequencies in the system (e.g., ν ≳MHz). We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests. We use a 1024 × 1024 periodic square lattice with spacing δx = 0.190 ξ and timestep δt = 0.0362 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ); this allows a gap of ≈42.5 ξ between the walls of the box trap and each end of the lattice, which is large enough that the system is completely insensitive to the periodicity. We run each simulation up to a maximum time of t = 1180 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ), which is roughly double the sound-crossing time across the condensate. We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench. These potentials are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding ground-state density profiles for the condensate, which we compute numerically by evolving the equations of motion for ψ↓, ψ↑in imaginary time from homogeneous initial conditions [77].

We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench. These potentials are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding ground-state density profiles for the condensate, which we compute numerically by evolving the equations of motion for ψ↓, ψ↑in imaginary time from homogeneous initial conditions [77]. B. Results We investigate bubble nucleation in each of these two potentials by running ensembles of 512 simulations. Each simulation has an independent random realization of the vacuum fluctuations around the mean condensate profile, which is generated by populating the tower of energy eigenmodes above the false vacuum; see App. B for details on how we compute these modes for each trapping potential. In order to test the thin-wall Euclidean predictions of Sec. II, we carry out two comparisons between ensembles. First, we compare nucleation in the bucket trap and in the trench trap for the ‘high density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3. We choose these parameters such that the bulk nucleation timescale is much longer than the simulation time, so that no bubbles are expected to form in the absence of boundary effects. However, the bucket trap causes the system to decay well within the simulation time, as shown in panel (a) of Fig. 4. We visually confirm that, as predicted in Sec. II, every simulation in the bucket-trap ensemble decays by nucleating one or more edge bubbles, which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2 (see top row of Fig. 3). Modifying the trapping potential completely eliminates this decay channel, with every simulation in the trench-trap ensemble surviving to the end of the simulation time. Second, we compare nucleation in the trench trap and in a periodic system with no trap for the ‘low density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3/2. The periodic simulations are carried out on a 512 × 512 lattice   6 0 200 400 600 800 1000 (mφc2 φ/¯h) t −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 ⟨cos[φ(t, x)]⟩vol.

We choose the ‘low density’ parameters so that the Euclidean action (5) associated with bulk nucleation is approximately half of that in the ‘high density’ case; our expectation is therefore that bulk nucleation in the low-density setup should occur at a comparable rate to edge nucleation in the high-density setup above. As shown in panel (b) of Fig. 4, this is indeed the case: both the trench-trap ensemble and the periodic ensemble decay within the simulation time at essentially the same rate. This confirms that the decay rate is insensitive to the presence of a boundary once the trench trap has been implemented. We also confirm visually that every simulation in this low-density trenchtrap ensemble decays via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk (see bottom row of Fig. 3). The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV."

    "paragraph": "The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67]. By running a large ensemble of such simulations, one can then approximate quantum expectation values of observables by computing averages across the ensemble. This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics. For our purposes here, the lattice simulations are simply a cross-check of the Euclidean predictions in Sec. II. We find that the two approaches are in complete agreement on the question of edge nucleation. A. Physical parameters We simulate a quasi-2D analog system, in which the atoms are tightly confined along the vertical direction by a harmonic potential V⊥(z) = 1 2mω2 ⊥z2. This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency. The latter is assumed to be much faster than all other frequencies in the system (e.g., ν ≳MHz). We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests.

We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests. We use a 1024 × 1024 periodic square lattice with spacing δx = 0.190 ξ and timestep δt = 0.0362 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ); this allows a gap of ≈42.5 ξ between the walls of the box trap and each end of the lattice, which is large enough that the system is completely insensitive to the periodicity. We run each simulation up to a maximum time of t = 1180 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ), which is roughly double the sound-crossing time across the condensate. We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench. These potentials are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding ground-state density profiles for the condensate, which we compute numerically by evolving the equations of motion for ψ↓, ψ↑in imaginary time from homogeneous initial conditions [77]. B. Results We investigate bubble nucleation in each of these two potentials by running ensembles of 512 simulations. Each simulation has an independent random realization of the vacuum fluctuations around the mean condensate profile, which is generated by populating the tower of energy eigenmodes above the false vacuum; see App. B for details on how we compute these modes for each trapping potential. In order to test the thin-wall Euclidean predictions of Sec. II, we carry out two comparisons between ensembles. First, we compare nucleation in the bucket trap and in the trench trap for the ‘high density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3. We choose these parameters such that the bulk nucleation timescale is much longer than the simulation time, so that no bubbles are expected to form in the absence of boundary effects. However, the bucket trap causes the system to decay well within the simulation time, as shown in panel (a) of Fig. 4. We visually confirm that, as predicted in Sec. II, every simulation in the bucket-trap ensemble decays by nucleating one or more edge bubbles, which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2 (see top row of Fig. 3). Modifying the trapping potential completely eliminates this decay channel, with every simulation in the trench-trap ensemble surviving to the end of the simulation time. Second, we compare nucleation in the trench trap and in a periodic system with no trap for the ‘low density’ parameters described above, for which Nξ2/A = 3/2. The periodic simulations are carried out on a 512 × 512 lattice   6 0 200 400 600 800 1000 (mφc2 φ/¯h) t −1.0 −0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 ⟨cos[φ(t, x)]⟩vol.

This quantity serves as a diagnostic of vacuum decay, starting near to the false vacuum value cos ϕfv = −1, and transitioning toward the true vacuum value cos ϕtv = +1 in cases where bubble nucleation occurs (whether on the edge or in the bulk). Solid curves show the median value as a function of time for each ensemble, while shaded regions contain 95.5% of the probability (equivalent to ±2σ if the distribution were Gaussian). with the same physical lattice spacing δx, such that the volume of the periodic box is approximately equal to that of the interior of the trap. We choose the ‘low density’ parameters so that the Euclidean action (5) associated with bulk nucleation is approximately half of that in the ‘high density’ case; our expectation is therefore that bulk nucleation in the low-density setup should occur at a comparable rate to edge nucleation in the high-density setup above. As shown in panel (b) of Fig. 4, this is indeed the case: both the trench-trap ensemble and the periodic ensemble decay within the simulation time at essentially the same rate. This confirms that the decay rate is insensitive to the presence of a boundary once the trench trap has been implemented. We also confirm visually that every simulation in this low-density trenchtrap ensemble decays via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk (see bottom row of Fig. 3). The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV."

    "paragraph": "The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67]. By running a large ensemble of such simulations, one can then approximate quantum expectation values of observables by computing averages across the ensemble. This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics. For our purposes here, the lattice simulations are simply a cross-check of the Euclidean predictions in Sec. II. We find that the two approaches are in complete agreement on the question of edge nucleation. A. Physical parameters We simulate a quasi-2D analog system, in which the atoms are tightly confined along the vertical direction by a harmonic potential V⊥(z) = 1 2mω2 ⊥z2. This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency.

A key challenge for this program is ensuring the faithfulness of the early-Universe analogy in these experiments by characterizing and mitigating any noncosmological behavior. In this paper we have identified the presence of boundaries in the system as potentially problematic for analog vacuum decay, showing that they generically lead to rapid decay via nucleation of ‘edge bubbles’, which have no cosmological counterpart. However, we have shown that this failure mode can be straightforwardly eliminated by suitably engineering the optical potential used to trap the atoms: creating a high-density ‘trench’ layer prohibits edge nucleation, and allows one to observe the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. Identical conclusions are found in a companion paper [62], which investigates thermal nucleation in a broader range of analog systems. This trench solution demonstrates how current experimental capabilities—e.g., the ability to imprint highly customizable optical traps using digi  7 tal micromirror devices [65, 66]—enable faithful analog simulations of early-Universe theories. Our results bring us a step closer to simulating vacuum decay with cold atoms. There remain further experimental complications that we plan to investigate in future work. These include characterizing the effects of various noise sources (including magnetic field noise and fluctuations in the optical potential), as well as developing a better understanding of the small-scale behavior of the system, particularly regarding the damping of Floquet instabilities associated with the modulated Rabi coupling [6].

The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5.

The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6.

Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi.

(B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar.

(B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6.

Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi.

(not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m.

Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

(A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar.

(B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6.

Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi.

The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ.

It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum.

We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6.

We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi.

Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

(A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑. (B2) For each sector we carry out a Bogoliubov transformation, δ ˆψ(x) = X i h ui(x)ˆai −vi(x)ˆa† i i , (B3) where i labels normal modes of the system, and the mode functions ui, vi are chosen such that they diagonalize the Hamiltonian (A1), ˆH = Z dx ˆH ≃E0 + X i h ℏωθ,iˆa† θ,iˆaθ,i + ℏωϕ,iˆa† ϕ,iˆaϕ,i i , (B4) n = 0 m = 0 n = 1 n = 2 n = 3 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 Figure 5. The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi = Z dℓ(Hi −¯Hfv), (A6) where dℓis a line element running perpendicular to the interface, and ¯Hfv is the background energy density associated with the homogeneous false vacuum. For a bubble wall in the bulk, we set V = 0 and solve for the small density perturbations n−¯nfv and χ as functions of ϕ. We find σb = r 4ϵ ℏ2κ¯n3 fv m (1 −z2)I(λ), (A7) where I(λ) is a dimensionless integral depending only on the barrier height λ, which approaches I(λ) →λ in the thin-wall limit λ ≫1. Crucially, we see that σb = O \u0000ϵ1/2\u0001 ; as discussed in Sec. II, this is because the excess energy density in the bubble wall is O(ϵ), but the thickness of the wall is ℓ= O \u0000ϵ−1/2\u0001 . For interfaces with the walls of the bucket trap, we treat the potential as an infinite planar hard wall, V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, ∞ if x < 0, (bucket). (A8) This approximation allows us to derive closed-form analytical expressions for the surface tensions; however, we expect our key findings to be insensitive to this choice, so long as the potential ‘switches on’ over a lengthscale comparable to the healing length ξ = ℏ/√2mµ. The false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ.

It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum.

The first few eigenmodes for relative phase fluctuations in the trench potential. We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs. (B3) and (B4), we find the Bogoliubov equations that determine the mode functions for each fluctuation sector, which are of the form ℏωiui = Aui −Bvi, −ℏωivi = Avi −Bui, (B5) where A, B are linear differential operators. The solutions to this system are normalized according to Z dx (uiu∗ j −viv∗ j ) = δij (B6) to ensure the ladder operators obey the usual commutation relations. The coupled system (B5) is somewhat awkward to solve directly. Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩.

Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .

Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Instead, it is convenient to take the odd and even combinations, ℏωiu+,i = L+u−,i, ℏωiu−,i = L−u+,i, (B7)   10 10−1 100 101 ξk 10−2 10−1 100 101 Pφ(k) Theory (relativistic) Theory (analog system) Lattice data Figure 6. Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt. (B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

(B10) We extract the mode amplitudes from the simulation and find that they each obey (B10) with relative accuracy of 10−3 or better over many oscillation periods. This confirms that the modes diagonalize the Hamiltonian to high accuracy in the linear regime, and that the energy eigenvalues ℏωmn are accurate. Our second test is to compute the initial power spectrum of the relative phase field, Pϕ(k) = Z dx V eik·(x′−x) ⟨ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)⟩. (B11) We do this by averaging over the 512 simulations in our high-density trench ensemble, focusing on a square subregion of side length ≈80 ξ that is contained entirely within the bulk, and using a Slepian window to suppress spectral leakage. As shown in Fig. 6, we find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum. This demonstrates that our numerical framework accurately reproduces the fluctuation statistics of the corresponding periodic system in the bulk region of the trap. [1] B. Opanchuk, R.

Initial power spectrum of the relative phase field in our simulations (shaded region, which shows ±1σ around the estimated spectrum), as estimated from the bulk region of our high-density trench ensemble at time zero. We find excellent agreement with the expected spectrum for a periodic analog system (dashed blue curve), including the UV cutoff at k ≈8.25/ξ and the slight excess UV power compared to the corresponding relativistic theory (solid red curve). where we define u±,i = ui ±vi and L± = A±B. Chaining these equations together yields (ℏωi)2u+,i = L+L−u+,i, (ℏωi)2u−,i = L−L+u−,i, (B8) each of which is a self-contained eigenvalue problem that is amenable to solution via standard numerical methods. Our procedure is therefore: (1) find the eigenvalues (ℏωi)2 and eigenfunctions u+,i of the operator L+L−; (2) for each u+,i, apply the operator L−and divide by ℏωi to find the corresponding u−,i; (3) take odd and even combinations and enforce the normalization (B6) to find the mode functions ui, vi. Since we are working on the lattice, step (1) above involves approximating the operators L± as matrices acting on vectors that specify u± at each lattice site. Naively, for a 2D lattice with N 2 sites, this means diagonalizing a matrix of size N 2 × N 2 and storing the resulting N 2 eigenvectors. This is infeasible for N = 1024. Instead, we exploit the circular symmetry of the system and work in polar coordinates (r, θ). The mode functions can then be written as ui(x) = umn(x) = Umn(r)eimθ, vi(x) = vmn(x) = Vmn(r)eimθ, (B9) where m = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . (not to be confused with the atomic mass) labels modes of different angular momenta, and n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (not to be confused with the number density) labels energy levels for each m. The problem then reduces to solving a radial eigenvalue equation for each m, described in terms of an N ×N matrix. We generate these matrices using a pseudospectral representation for the differential operators L±, and use the same pseudospectral scheme to interpolate the resulting radial mode functions on the Cartesian lattice used in the simulations. This procedure is carried out separately for each of the two trapping potentials described in Sec. III; Fig. 5 shows the first few modes in the trench case. We perform two tests to confirm that the resulting Bogoliubov modes accurately describe the vacuum fluctuations of the system. First, we carry out a truncated Wigner simulation with extremely small initial fluctuation amplitudes, corresponding to Nξ2/A = 108. Interactions between modes should be negligible in this regime, so that each mode simply oscillates at its natural frequency, ˆamn(t) ≃ˆamn(0) e−iωmnt.

The top row shows a bucket potential, while the bottom row shows a trench potential. White dotted circles in the bottom row show the inner edge of the trench. In the bucket, the initial false vacuum state (blue) decays by nucleating edge bubbles (red), which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2. In the trench, edge nucleation is prevented, and the decay occurs instead via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk. The resulting bubbles are more noticeably aspherical due to the different physical parameters being simulated, which correspond to a shallower effective potential around the false vacuum. micromirror device to sculpt an optical potential with the desired profile [65, 66]. In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk. As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem. III. LATTICE SIMULATIONS The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67]. By running a large ensemble of such simulations, one can then approximate quantum expectation values of observables by computing averages across the ensemble. This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics. For our purposes here, the lattice simulations are simply a cross-check of the Euclidean predictions in Sec. II. We find that the two approaches are in complete agreement on the question of edge nucleation. A. Physical parameters We simulate a quasi-2D analog system, in which the atoms are tightly confined along the vertical direction by a harmonic potential V⊥(z) = 1 2mω2 ⊥z2. This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency. The latter is assumed to be much faster than all other frequencies in the system (e.g., ν ≳MHz). We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests. We use a 1024 × 1024 periodic square lattice with spacing δx = 0.190 ξ and timestep δt = 0.0362 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ); this allows a gap of ≈42.5 ξ between the walls of the box trap and each end of the lattice, which is large enough that the system is completely insensitive to the periodicity. We run each simulation up to a maximum time of t = 1180 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ), which is roughly double the sound-crossing time across the condensate. We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench. These potentials are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding ground-state density profiles for the condensate, which we compute numerically by evolving the equations of motion for ψ↓, ψ↑in imaginary time from homogeneous initial conditions [77].

This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics. For our purposes here, the lattice simulations are simply a cross-check of the Euclidean predictions in Sec. II. We find that the two approaches are in complete agreement on the question of edge nucleation. A. Physical parameters We simulate a quasi-2D analog system, in which the atoms are tightly confined along the vertical direction by a harmonic potential V⊥(z) = 1 2mω2 ⊥z2. This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency. The latter is assumed to be much faster than all other frequencies in the system (e.g., ν ≳MHz). We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests. We use a 1024 × 1024 periodic square lattice with spacing δx = 0.190 ξ and timestep δt = 0.0362 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ); this allows a gap of ≈42.5 ξ between the walls of the box trap and each end of the lattice, which is large enough that the system is completely insensitive to the periodicity. We run each simulation up to a maximum time of t = 1180 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ), which is roughly double the sound-crossing time across the condensate. We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench. These potentials are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding ground-state density profiles for the condensate, which we compute numerically by evolving the equations of motion for ψ↓, ψ↑in imaginary time from homogeneous initial conditions [77].

The top row shows a bucket potential, while the bottom row shows a trench potential. White dotted circles in the bottom row show the inner edge of the trench.

In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk. As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem. III. LATTICE SIMULATIONS The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67].

The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk. As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem. III. LATTICE SIMULATIONS The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67]. By running a large ensemble of such simulations, one can then approximate quantum expectation values of observables by computing averages across the ensemble. This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics. For our purposes here, the lattice simulations are simply a cross-check of the Euclidean predictions in Sec. II. We find that the two approaches are in complete agreement on the question of edge nucleation. A. Physical parameters We simulate a quasi-2D analog system, in which the atoms are tightly confined along the vertical direction by a harmonic potential V⊥(z) = 1 2mω2 ⊥z2. This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency. The latter is assumed to be much faster than all other frequencies in the system (e.g., ν ≳MHz). We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests. We use a 1024 × 1024 periodic square lattice with spacing δx = 0.190 ξ and timestep δt = 0.0362 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ); this allows a gap of ≈42.5 ξ between the walls of the box trap and each end of the lattice, which is large enough that the system is completely insensitive to the periodicity. We run each simulation up to a maximum time of t = 1180 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ), which is roughly double the sound-crossing time across the condensate. We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench. These potentials are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding ground-state density profiles for the condensate, which we compute numerically by evolving the equations of motion for ψ↓, ψ↑in imaginary time from homogeneous initial conditions [77].

We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench. These potentials are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding ground-state density profiles for the condensate, which we compute numerically by evolving the equations of motion for ψ↓, ψ↑in imaginary time from homogeneous initial conditions [77].

In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk. As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq.

III. LATTICE SIMULATIONS The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67]. By running a large ensemble of such simulations, one can then approximate quantum expectation values of observables by computing averages across the ensemble. This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics. For our purposes here, the lattice simulations are simply a cross-check of the Euclidean predictions in Sec. II. We find that the two approaches are in complete agreement on the question of edge nucleation. A. Physical parameters We simulate a quasi-2D analog system, in which the atoms are tightly confined along the vertical direction by a harmonic potential V⊥(z) = 1 2mω2 ⊥z2. This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency. The latter is assumed to be much faster than all other frequencies in the system (e.g., ν ≳MHz). We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests. We use a 1024 × 1024 periodic square lattice with spacing δx = 0.190 ξ and timestep δt = 0.0362 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ); this allows a gap of ≈42.5 ξ between the walls of the box trap and each end of the lattice, which is large enough that the system is completely insensitive to the periodicity.

This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency. The latter is assumed to be much faster than all other frequencies in the system (e.g., ν ≳MHz). We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests. We use a 1024 × 1024 periodic square lattice with spacing δx = 0.190 ξ and timestep δt = 0.0362 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ); this allows a gap of ≈42.5 ξ between the walls of the box trap and each end of the lattice, which is large enough that the system is completely insensitive to the periodicity. We run each simulation up to a maximum time of t = 1180 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ), which is roughly double the sound-crossing time across the condensate. We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench. These potentials are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding ground-state density profiles for the condensate, which we compute numerically by evolving the equations of motion for ψ↓, ψ↑in imaginary time from homogeneous initial conditions [77].

In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk. As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem. III. LATTICE SIMULATIONS The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67]. By running a large ensemble of such simulations, one can then approximate quantum expectation values of observables by computing averages across the ensemble. This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics.

As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem. III. LATTICE SIMULATIONS The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67]. By running a large ensemble of such simulations, one can then approximate quantum expectation values of observables by computing averages across the ensemble. This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics. For our purposes here, the lattice simulations are simply a cross-check of the Euclidean predictions in Sec. II. We find that the two approaches are in complete agreement on the question of edge nucleation. A. Physical parameters We simulate a quasi-2D analog system, in which the atoms are tightly confined along the vertical direction by a harmonic potential V⊥(z) = 1 2mω2 ⊥z2. This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency. The latter is assumed to be much faster than all other frequencies in the system (e.g., ν ≳MHz). We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests. We use a 1024 × 1024 periodic square lattice with spacing δx = 0.190 ξ and timestep δt = 0.0362 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ); this allows a gap of ≈42.5 ξ between the walls of the box trap and each end of the lattice, which is large enough that the system is completely insensitive to the periodicity. We run each simulation up to a maximum time of t = 1180 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ), which is roughly double the sound-crossing time across the condensate. We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench. These potentials are shown in Fig. 2, along with the corresponding ground-state density profiles for the condensate, which we compute numerically by evolving the equations of motion for ψ↓, ψ↑in imaginary time from homogeneous initial conditions [77].

In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk.

We simulate two circularly-symmetric trapping potentials: a ‘bucket’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (12) and a ‘trench’ potential of the form V (r) = 1 2Vmax \u0014 1 + tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013\u0015 + 1 2Vtrench \u0014 tanh \u0012r −r0 −w ξ \u0013 −tanh \u0012r −r0 ξ \u0013\u0015 , (13) where Vmax = 841 ℏ2/(mξ2) is the height of the potential barrier (which we make very large to prevent highmomentum modes from escaping), r0 = 55.0 ξ is the approximate radial size of the bulk region, Vtrench = ℏ2/(2mξ2) is the depth of the trench, and w = 9.75 ξ is the width of the trench.

The top row shows a bucket potential, while the bottom row shows a trench potential. White dotted circles in the bottom row show the inner edge of the trench. In the bucket, the initial false vacuum state (blue) decays by nucleating edge bubbles (red), which meet the boundary at an angle of approximately θ ≃π/2.

The resulting bubbles are more noticeably aspherical due to the different physical parameters being simulated, which correspond to a shallower effective potential around the false vacuum. micromirror device to sculpt an optical potential with the desired profile [65, 66]. In particular, if one can set θ = π, then the edge nucleation problem is immediately solved; it is then only possible to form an entire bubble, which can graze the boundary but not intersect it. The bulk nucleation of spherical bubbles then becomes the minimum-action Euclidean solution, and is therefore expected to be the dominant decay channel, as it is in the early-Universe scenarios we wish to probe. This can be achieved by creating a ‘trench’ layer inside the walls of the box, in which the potential is lower than in the bulk region and the mean atomic density n = (n↓+ n↑)/2 is therefore higher (see Fig. 2). The Euclidean action (5) is directly proportional to n due to the increased self-interaction energy of a higher-density condensate, so all bubble nucleation processes in the trench are exponentially suppressed compared to those in the bulk. As a result, we can treat the trench as being trapped in the false vacuum on the timescales relevant to bulk nucleation. Crucially, this means that the interface between a true vacuum bubble in the bulk and the high-density false vacuum in the trench consists of both a phase profile (i.e., a bubble wall) and a density profile. As we show in detail in App. A, this means that the associated surface tension is just the sum of the bubble wall tension and the false vacuum bulk–trench interface tension, σtv = σfv + σb. (11) Comparing with Eq. (7), we see that the contact angle is θ = π as desired; the energy cost of forming an interface with the trench repels any bubbles, and homogeneous nucleation of spherical bubbles in the bulk is preferred, solving the edge nucleation problem. III. LATTICE SIMULATIONS The arguments in Sec. II provide analytical evidence for the edge nucleation problem, and for a solution to this problem in the form of a trench potential. Here we verify these predictions using real-time lattice simulations. There are two reasons for doing this. First, the analytical predictions rely on a thin-wall description of the system, valid in the limit λ ≫1, whereas much of the experimental parameter space of interest is in the thick-wall regime, λ ≈ 1. Second, these predictions describe both bulk and edge nucleation in terms of the Euclidean instanton formalism, whereas one of the core goals of the analog vacuum decay program is to test this formalism. In particular, our goal is to test whether these idealized imaginary-time predictions are borne out in the dynamical real-time evolution of the system. We use semiclassical real-time lattice simulations, in which the initial state contains a random draw of the vacuum fluctuations in the ψ↓, ψ↑fields, which is then evolved forward in real time using the classical equations of motion [67]. By running a large ensemble of such simulations, one can then approximate quantum expectation values of observables by computing averages across the ensemble. This approach underpins many numerical simulations of early-Universe phenomena [68–72], and is also widely used in atomic physics and quantum optics, where it is known as the truncated Wigner approximation [67, 73]. In the context of vacuum decay, these simulations complement the Euclidean formalism by providing an alternative description that is formally valid to the same semiclassical order, but which gives much richer real-time dynamical information about the system. While many of the predictions of the Euclidean formalism have been reproduced using these simulations, they tend to predict significantly   5 faster nucleation rates [12, 67] (although accounting for renormalization effects could potentially resolve this discrepancy [74]). Analog experiments will eventually shed light on the relationship between these two approaches and how well they approximate the full quantum dynamics. For our purposes here, the lattice simulations are simply a cross-check of the Euclidean predictions in Sec. II. We find that the two approaches are in complete agreement on the question of edge nucleation. A. Physical parameters We simulate a quasi-2D analog system, in which the atoms are tightly confined along the vertical direction by a harmonic potential V⊥(z) = 1 2mω2 ⊥z2. This setup is experimentally preferred over a 3D system as it allows the entire field to be directly imaged (rather than being reconstructed from line-of-sight-integrated images), and also avoids challenges associated with levitating both atomic species equally against gravity. Our states |↓⟩ and |↑⟩correspond to the |F, mF ⟩= |1, 0⟩and |1, −1⟩ hyperfine states of 39K, respectively. In a uniform magnetic field B ≈57.5 G the nonlinear two-body interactions between these states are such that the effective relativistic equation of motion (2) for the relative phase field ϕ is achieved by setting the population imbalance (n↓−n↑)/(n↓+ n↑) ≈0.298 [13, 62, 75]. The nucleation rate for both bulk and edge bubbles is set by the dimensionless number density Nξ2/A, where N is the total number of atoms, A is the 2D volume of the system, and ξ is the healing length. One can vary this dimensionless density while keeping the healing length fixed by varying the transverse trapping frequency as ω⊥∝N −1/2 [12]. We consider two points along this curve: a ‘high density’ setup with N = 4.80 × 105 and ω⊥= 32.9 × 2π kHz, and a ‘low density’ setup with N = 2.40 × 105 and ω⊥= 132 × 2π kHz. In both cases we consider a circular trap in the 2D plane with radius r ≈ 50 ξ. The overall scale of the system is not fixed by the above parameters; here we set ξ = 1 µm, which is typical of quasi-2D cold-atom experiments [28, 76]. For the Rabi coupling that generates the effective potential (3) we take ϵ = 4.11 × 10−3, corresponding to a mean Rabi frequency Ω0 = 18.8 × 2π Hz, and λ = 1.1, corresponding to a modulation amplitude ∆Ω= 9.97 × 10−2 ν, with ν the modulation frequency. The latter is assumed to be much faster than all other frequencies in the system (e.g., ν ≳MHz). We simulate this setup using a Fourier pseudospectral lattice code with an eighth-order symplectic time-stepping scheme—see Refs. [12, 13] for details, including numerical convergence tests. We use a 1024 × 1024 periodic square lattice with spacing δx = 0.190 ξ and timestep δt = 0.0362 ℏ/(mϕc2 ϕ); this allows a gap of ≈42.5 ξ between the walls of the box trap and each end of the lattice, which is large enough that the system is completely insensitive to the periodicity.

    "paragraph": "Figure 4. Time evolution of the volume-averaged cosine of the relative phase field for each of our ensembles of lattice simulations. This quantity serves as a diagnostic of vacuum decay, starting near to the false vacuum value cos ϕfv = −1, and transitioning toward the true vacuum value cos ϕtv = +1 in cases where bubble nucleation occurs (whether on the edge or in the bulk). Solid curves show the median value as a function of time for each ensemble, while shaded regions contain 95.5% of the probability (equivalent to ±2σ if the distribution were Gaussian). with the same physical lattice spacing δx, such that the volume of the periodic box is approximately equal to that of the interior of the trap. We choose the ‘low density’ parameters so that the Euclidean action (5) associated with bulk nucleation is approximately half of that in the ‘high density’ case; our expectation is therefore that bulk nucleation in the low-density setup should occur at a comparable rate to edge nucleation in the high-density setup above. As shown in panel (b) of Fig. 4, this is indeed the case: both the trench-trap ensemble and the periodic ensemble decay within the simulation time at essentially the same rate. This confirms that the decay rate is insensitive to the presence of a boundary once the trench trap has been implemented. We also confirm visually that every simulation in this low-density trenchtrap ensemble decays via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk (see bottom row of Fig. 3). The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK Cold-atom analog experiments will soon enable empirical tests of relativistic false vacuum decay in the laboratory, giving new insights into the physics of the very early Universe. A key challenge for this program is ensuring the faithfulness of the early-Universe analogy in these experiments by characterizing and mitigating any noncosmological behavior. In this paper we have identified the presence of boundaries in the system as potentially problematic for analog vacuum decay, showing that they generically lead to rapid decay via nucleation of ‘edge bubbles’, which have no cosmological counterpart. However, we have shown that this failure mode can be straightforwardly eliminated by suitably engineering the optical potential used to trap the atoms: creating a high-density ‘trench’ layer prohibits edge nucleation, and allows one to observe the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. Identical conclusions are found in a companion paper [62], which investigates thermal nucleation in a broader range of analog systems. This trench solution demonstrates how current experimental capabilities—e.g., the ability to imprint highly customizable optical traps using digi  7 tal micromirror devices [65, 66]—enable faithful analog simulations of early-Universe theories. Our results bring us a step closer to simulating vacuum decay with cold atoms. There remain further experimental complications that we plan to investigate in future work. These include characterizing the effects of various noise sources (including magnetic field noise and fluctuations in the optical potential), as well as developing a better understanding of the small-scale behavior of the system, particularly regarding the damping of Floquet instabilities associated with the modulated Rabi coupling [6]. There are also important open questions regarding how the effective scalar field potential (3) is renormalized by the small-scale modes, and how these renormalization corrections differ from the pure Klein Gordon case studied in Ref. [74]. Understanding these issues will afford us greater control over our theoretical predictions, allowing us to extract the maximum possible insight into cosmological physics from upcoming analog experiments.

This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 .

This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq.

We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq.

    "paragraph": "Figure 4. Time evolution of the volume-averaged cosine of the relative phase field for each of our ensembles of lattice simulations. This quantity serves as a diagnostic of vacuum decay, starting near to the false vacuum value cos ϕfv = −1, and transitioning toward the true vacuum value cos ϕtv = +1 in cases where bubble nucleation occurs (whether on the edge or in the bulk). Solid curves show the median value as a function of time for each ensemble, while shaded regions contain 95.5% of the probability (equivalent to ±2σ if the distribution were Gaussian). with the same physical lattice spacing δx, such that the volume of the periodic box is approximately equal to that of the interior of the trap. We choose the ‘low density’ parameters so that the Euclidean action (5) associated with bulk nucleation is approximately half of that in the ‘high density’ case; our expectation is therefore that bulk nucleation in the low-density setup should occur at a comparable rate to edge nucleation in the high-density setup above. As shown in panel (b) of Fig. 4, this is indeed the case: both the trench-trap ensemble and the periodic ensemble decay within the simulation time at essentially the same rate. This confirms that the decay rate is insensitive to the presence of a boundary once the trench trap has been implemented. We also confirm visually that every simulation in this low-density trenchtrap ensemble decays via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk (see bottom row of Fig. 3). The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK Cold-atom analog experiments will soon enable empirical tests of relativistic false vacuum decay in the laboratory, giving new insights into the physics of the very early Universe. A key challenge for this program is ensuring the faithfulness of the early-Universe analogy in these experiments by characterizing and mitigating any noncosmological behavior. In this paper we have identified the presence of boundaries in the system as potentially problematic for analog vacuum decay, showing that they generically lead to rapid decay via nucleation of ‘edge bubbles’, which have no cosmological counterpart. However, we have shown that this failure mode can be straightforwardly eliminated by suitably engineering the optical potential used to trap the atoms: creating a high-density ‘trench’ layer prohibits edge nucleation, and allows one to observe the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. Identical conclusions are found in a companion paper [62], which investigates thermal nucleation in a broader range of analog systems. This trench solution demonstrates how current experimental capabilities—e.g., the ability to imprint highly customizable optical traps using digi  7 tal micromirror devices [65, 66]—enable faithful analog simulations of early-Universe theories. Our results bring us a step closer to simulating vacuum decay with cold atoms. There remain further experimental complications that we plan to investigate in future work. These include characterizing the effects of various noise sources (including magnetic field noise and fluctuations in the optical potential), as well as developing a better understanding of the small-scale behavior of the system, particularly regarding the damping of Floquet instabilities associated with the modulated Rabi coupling [6]. There are also important open questions regarding how the effective scalar field potential (3) is renormalized by the small-scale modes, and how these renormalization corrections differ from the pure Klein Gordon case studied in Ref. [74]. Understanding these issues will afford us greater control over our theoretical predictions, allowing us to extract the maximum possible insight into cosmological physics from upcoming analog experiments.

We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq.

    "paragraph": "Figure 4. Time evolution of the volume-averaged cosine of the relative phase field for each of our ensembles of lattice simulations. This quantity serves as a diagnostic of vacuum decay, starting near to the false vacuum value cos ϕfv = −1, and transitioning toward the true vacuum value cos ϕtv = +1 in cases where bubble nucleation occurs (whether on the edge or in the bulk). Solid curves show the median value as a function of time for each ensemble, while shaded regions contain 95.5% of the probability (equivalent to ±2σ if the distribution were Gaussian). with the same physical lattice spacing δx, such that the volume of the periodic box is approximately equal to that of the interior of the trap. We choose the ‘low density’ parameters so that the Euclidean action (5) associated with bulk nucleation is approximately half of that in the ‘high density’ case; our expectation is therefore that bulk nucleation in the low-density setup should occur at a comparable rate to edge nucleation in the high-density setup above. As shown in panel (b) of Fig. 4, this is indeed the case: both the trench-trap ensemble and the periodic ensemble decay within the simulation time at essentially the same rate. This confirms that the decay rate is insensitive to the presence of a boundary once the trench trap has been implemented. We also confirm visually that every simulation in this low-density trenchtrap ensemble decays via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk (see bottom row of Fig. 3). The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK Cold-atom analog experiments will soon enable empirical tests of relativistic false vacuum decay in the laboratory, giving new insights into the physics of the very early Universe. A key challenge for this program is ensuring the faithfulness of the early-Universe analogy in these experiments by characterizing and mitigating any noncosmological behavior. In this paper we have identified the presence of boundaries in the system as potentially problematic for analog vacuum decay, showing that they generically lead to rapid decay via nucleation of ‘edge bubbles’, which have no cosmological counterpart. However, we have shown that this failure mode can be straightforwardly eliminated by suitably engineering the optical potential used to trap the atoms: creating a high-density ‘trench’ layer prohibits edge nucleation, and allows one to observe the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. Identical conclusions are found in a companion paper [62], which investigates thermal nucleation in a broader range of analog systems. This trench solution demonstrates how current experimental capabilities—e.g., the ability to imprint highly customizable optical traps using digi  7 tal micromirror devices [65, 66]—enable faithful analog simulations of early-Universe theories. Our results bring us a step closer to simulating vacuum decay with cold atoms. There remain further experimental complications that we plan to investigate in future work. These include characterizing the effects of various noise sources (including magnetic field noise and fluctuations in the optical potential), as well as developing a better understanding of the small-scale behavior of the system, particularly regarding the damping of Floquet instabilities associated with the modulated Rabi coupling [6]. There are also important open questions regarding how the effective scalar field potential (3) is renormalized by the small-scale modes, and how these renormalization corrections differ from the pure Klein Gordon case studied in Ref. [74]. Understanding these issues will afford us greater control over our theoretical predictions, allowing us to extract the maximum possible insight into cosmological physics from upcoming analog experiments.

    "paragraph": "Figure 4. Time evolution of the volume-averaged cosine of the relative phase field for each of our ensembles of lattice simulations. This quantity serves as a diagnostic of vacuum decay, starting near to the false vacuum value cos ϕfv = −1, and transitioning toward the true vacuum value cos ϕtv = +1 in cases where bubble nucleation occurs (whether on the edge or in the bulk). Solid curves show the median value as a function of time for each ensemble, while shaded regions contain 95.5% of the probability (equivalent to ±2σ if the distribution were Gaussian). with the same physical lattice spacing δx, such that the volume of the periodic box is approximately equal to that of the interior of the trap. We choose the ‘low density’ parameters so that the Euclidean action (5) associated with bulk nucleation is approximately half of that in the ‘high density’ case; our expectation is therefore that bulk nucleation in the low-density setup should occur at a comparable rate to edge nucleation in the high-density setup above. As shown in panel (b) of Fig. 4, this is indeed the case: both the trench-trap ensemble and the periodic ensemble decay within the simulation time at essentially the same rate. This confirms that the decay rate is insensitive to the presence of a boundary once the trench trap has been implemented. We also confirm visually that every simulation in this low-density trenchtrap ensemble decays via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk (see bottom row of Fig. 3). The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK Cold-atom analog experiments will soon enable empirical tests of relativistic false vacuum decay in the laboratory, giving new insights into the physics of the very early Universe. A key challenge for this program is ensuring the faithfulness of the early-Universe analogy in these experiments by characterizing and mitigating any noncosmological behavior. In this paper we have identified the presence of boundaries in the system as potentially problematic for analog vacuum decay, showing that they generically lead to rapid decay via nucleation of ‘edge bubbles’, which have no cosmological counterpart. However, we have shown that this failure mode can be straightforwardly eliminated by suitably engineering the optical potential used to trap the atoms: creating a high-density ‘trench’ layer prohibits edge nucleation, and allows one to observe the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. Identical conclusions are found in a companion paper [62], which investigates thermal nucleation in a broader range of analog systems. This trench solution demonstrates how current experimental capabilities—e.g., the ability to imprint highly customizable optical traps using digi  7 tal micromirror devices [65, 66]—enable faithful analog simulations of early-Universe theories. Our results bring us a step closer to simulating vacuum decay with cold atoms. There remain further experimental complications that we plan to investigate in future work. These include characterizing the effects of various noise sources (including magnetic field noise and fluctuations in the optical potential), as well as developing a better understanding of the small-scale behavior of the system, particularly regarding the damping of Floquet instabilities associated with the modulated Rabi coupling [6]. There are also important open questions regarding how the effective scalar field potential (3) is renormalized by the small-scale modes, and how these renormalization corrections differ from the pure Klein Gordon case studied in Ref. [74]. Understanding these issues will afford us greater control over our theoretical predictions, allowing us to extract the maximum possible insight into cosmological physics from upcoming analog experiments.

This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq.

We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation.

    "paragraph": "Figure 4. Time evolution of the volume-averaged cosine of the relative phase field for each of our ensembles of lattice simulations. This quantity serves as a diagnostic of vacuum decay, starting near to the false vacuum value cos ϕfv = −1, and transitioning toward the true vacuum value cos ϕtv = +1 in cases where bubble nucleation occurs (whether on the edge or in the bulk). Solid curves show the median value as a function of time for each ensemble, while shaded regions contain 95.5% of the probability (equivalent to ±2σ if the distribution were Gaussian). with the same physical lattice spacing δx, such that the volume of the periodic box is approximately equal to that of the interior of the trap. We choose the ‘low density’ parameters so that the Euclidean action (5) associated with bulk nucleation is approximately half of that in the ‘high density’ case; our expectation is therefore that bulk nucleation in the low-density setup should occur at a comparable rate to edge nucleation in the high-density setup above. As shown in panel (b) of Fig. 4, this is indeed the case: both the trench-trap ensemble and the periodic ensemble decay within the simulation time at essentially the same rate. This confirms that the decay rate is insensitive to the presence of a boundary once the trench trap has been implemented. We also confirm visually that every simulation in this low-density trenchtrap ensemble decays via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk (see bottom row of Fig. 3). The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK Cold-atom analog experiments will soon enable empirical tests of relativistic false vacuum decay in the laboratory, giving new insights into the physics of the very early Universe. A key challenge for this program is ensuring the faithfulness of the early-Universe analogy in these experiments by characterizing and mitigating any noncosmological behavior. In this paper we have identified the presence of boundaries in the system as potentially problematic for analog vacuum decay, showing that they generically lead to rapid decay via nucleation of ‘edge bubbles’, which have no cosmological counterpart. However, we have shown that this failure mode can be straightforwardly eliminated by suitably engineering the optical potential used to trap the atoms: creating a high-density ‘trench’ layer prohibits edge nucleation, and allows one to observe the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. Identical conclusions are found in a companion paper [62], which investigates thermal nucleation in a broader range of analog systems. This trench solution demonstrates how current experimental capabilities—e.g., the ability to imprint highly customizable optical traps using digi  7 tal micromirror devices [65, 66]—enable faithful analog simulations of early-Universe theories. Our results bring us a step closer to simulating vacuum decay with cold atoms. There remain further experimental complications that we plan to investigate in future work. These include characterizing the effects of various noise sources (including magnetic field noise and fluctuations in the optical potential), as well as developing a better understanding of the small-scale behavior of the system, particularly regarding the damping of Floquet instabilities associated with the modulated Rabi coupling [6]. There are also important open questions regarding how the effective scalar field potential (3) is renormalized by the small-scale modes, and how these renormalization corrections differ from the pure Klein Gordon case studied in Ref. [74]. Understanding these issues will afford us greater control over our theoretical predictions, allowing us to extract the maximum possible insight into cosmological physics from upcoming analog experiments.

This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq.

We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq.

The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK Cold-atom analog experiments will soon enable empirical tests of relativistic false vacuum decay in the laboratory, giving new insights into the physics of the very early Universe. A key challenge for this program is ensuring the faithfulness of the early-Universe analogy in these experiments by characterizing and mitigating any noncosmological behavior. In this paper we have identified the presence of boundaries in the system as potentially problematic for analog vacuum decay, showing that they generically lead to rapid decay via nucleation of ‘edge bubbles’, which have no cosmological counterpart. However, we have shown that this failure mode can be straightforwardly eliminated by suitably engineering the optical potential used to trap the atoms: creating a high-density ‘trench’ layer prohibits edge nucleation, and allows one to observe the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. Identical conclusions are found in a companion paper [62], which investigates thermal nucleation in a broader range of analog systems. This trench solution demonstrates how current experimental capabilities—e.g., the ability to imprint highly customizable optical traps using digi  7 tal micromirror devices [65, 66]—enable faithful analog simulations of early-Universe theories. Our results bring us a step closer to simulating vacuum decay with cold atoms. There remain further experimental complications that we plan to investigate in future work. These include characterizing the effects of various noise sources (including magnetic field noise and fluctuations in the optical potential), as well as developing a better understanding of the small-scale behavior of the system, particularly regarding the damping of Floquet instabilities associated with the modulated Rabi coupling [6]. There are also important open questions regarding how the effective scalar field potential (3) is renormalized by the small-scale modes, and how these renormalization corrections differ from the pure Klein Gordon case studied in Ref. [74]. Understanding these issues will afford us greater control over our theoretical predictions, allowing us to extract the maximum possible insight into cosmological physics from upcoming analog experiments.

The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq.

A key challenge for this program is ensuring the faithfulness of the early-Universe analogy in these experiments by characterizing and mitigating any noncosmological behavior. In this paper we have identified the presence of boundaries in the system as potentially problematic for analog vacuum decay, showing that they generically lead to rapid decay via nucleation of ‘edge bubbles’, which have no cosmological counterpart. However, we have shown that this failure mode can be straightforwardly eliminated by suitably engineering the optical potential used to trap the atoms: creating a high-density ‘trench’ layer prohibits edge nucleation, and allows one to observe the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. Identical conclusions are found in a companion paper [62], which investigates thermal nucleation in a broader range of analog systems. This trench solution demonstrates how current experimental capabilities—e.g., the ability to imprint highly customizable optical traps using digi  7 tal micromirror devices [65, 66]—enable faithful analog simulations of early-Universe theories. Our results bring us a step closer to simulating vacuum decay with cold atoms. There remain further experimental complications that we plan to investigate in future work. These include characterizing the effects of various noise sources (including magnetic field noise and fluctuations in the optical potential), as well as developing a better understanding of the small-scale behavior of the system, particularly regarding the damping of Floquet instabilities associated with the modulated Rabi coupling [6]. There are also important open questions regarding how the effective scalar field potential (3) is renormalized by the small-scale modes, and how these renormalization corrections differ from the pure Klein Gordon case studied in Ref. [74]. Understanding these issues will afford us greater control over our theoretical predictions, allowing us to extract the maximum possible insight into cosmological physics from upcoming analog experiments.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs.

The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 .

We choose the ‘low density’ parameters so that the Euclidean action (5) associated with bulk nucleation is approximately half of that in the ‘high density’ case; our expectation is therefore that bulk nucleation in the low-density setup should occur at a comparable rate to edge nucleation in the high-density setup above. As shown in panel (b) of Fig. 4, this is indeed the case: both the trench-trap ensemble and the periodic ensemble decay within the simulation time at essentially the same rate. This confirms that the decay rate is insensitive to the presence of a boundary once the trench trap has been implemented. We also confirm visually that every simulation in this low-density trenchtrap ensemble decays via homogeneous nucleation in the bulk (see bottom row of Fig. 3). The bubbles that form in the low-density simulations are noticeably more distorted and aspherical than the edge bubbles in the high-density simulations; this is an expected consequence of having higher-amplitude vacuum fluctuations, which renormalize the effective potential (3) and result in a shallower false vacuum barrier [74]. A shallower false vacuum also corresponds to thicker bubble walls and faster decay rates. In the extreme limit where the barrier vanishes, the system would undergo global spinodal decomposition, rather than forming localized bubbles. Here we are still in the regime of having well-defined bubble nucleation events, but can nonetheless see significant deviations from the standard paradigm of extremely rare and highly spherical thin-wall bubbles [35, 36]. This highlights one of the advantages of the analog experiments and of the real-time lattice simulations: that both allow one to study relativistic bubble nucleation in regimes where the Euclidean description starts to break down. In fact, practical limitations on experimental coherence times and numerical runtimes mean that thick-wall bubbles are the easiest regime to access with these methods; the very long decay times associated with spherical thin-wall bubbles make them more challenging to access in 2D simulations, and potentially also in the experimental context. This issue can always be circumvented using a 1D setup, as the decay rate is parametrically faster in lower dimensions [12, 13]. Future experiments will therefore be able to probe relativistic bubble nucleation across these different regimes, yielding insights into a broad range of cosmological scenarios. IV.

Understanding these issues will afford us greater control over our theoretical predictions, allowing us to extract the maximum possible insight into cosmological physics from upcoming analog experiments.

Appendix A: Surface tension calculations In this Appendix we calculate the surface tensions associated with each of the interfaces shown in Fig. 1, with the goal of deriving Eqs. (8) and (11) in the case of the bucket and trench traps, respectively. The cold-atom analog system is described by the timeaveraged Hamiltonian density [13] H = −ψ† ↓ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↓−ψ† ↑ ℏ2∇2 2m ψ↑+ (V −µ)(ψ† ↓ψ↓+ ψ† ↑ψ↑) −ϵ¯nfv p κ2 −∆2(ψ† ↓ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ↓) + ϵ∆¯nfv(ψ† ↓ψ↓−ψ† ↑ψ↑) + 1 2 \u0012 g −∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ −∆) \u0013 ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ↓ + 1 2 \u0012 g + ∆−ϵλ2 2 (κ + ∆) \u0013 ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↑ψ↑ + (g −κ(1 −ϵλ2))ψ† ↓ψ↓ψ† ↑ψ↑ −ϵλ2 4 κ(ψ† ↓ψ† ↓ψ↑ψ↑+ ψ† ↑ψ† ↑ψ↓ψ↓) + O \u0000ϵ2\u0001 , (A1) where the terms proportional to λ2 are generated by integrating out the rapid modulation of the Rabi coupling. This is done perturbatively in the small parameter ϵ associated with the mean value of the Rabi coupling; from now on we implicitly neglect all terms of order ϵ2. In Eq. (A1) we have defined g = g↓↓+ g↑↑ 2 , ∆= g↑↑−g↓↓ 2 , κ = g↓↓+ g↑↑−2g↓↑ 2 , (A2) where gij is the effective 2D two-body interaction between atomic states |i⟩and |j⟩. We also have V (x) the trapping potential, µ the chemical potential, and ¯nfv the uniform bulk number density in the false vacuum. We look for static solutions to the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian, allowing us to describe the various interfaces at rest, as appropriate at the moment of bubble nucleation. We therefore set iℏ∂tψ↓= ∂H ∂ψ† ↓ = 0, iℏ∂tψ↑= ∂H ∂ψ† ↑ = 0. (A3) It is convenient to write the atomic fields as ψ↓= p n(1 + z) exp \u0012 ϵz 2(1 + z)χ + 1 −z 2 iϕ \u0013 , ψ↑= p n(1 −z) exp \u0012 − ϵz 2(1 −z)χ −1 + z 2 iϕ \u0013 , (A4)   8 where n(x) is the mean number density per species and ϕ(x) is the relative phase, which admits an effective relativistic description on large scales. We have neglected the total phase field, setting it to zero everywhere. The background population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ is treated as constant everywhere, and is chosen such that the relative and total phase fields decouple from each other [13]. Finally, the field χ(x) corresponds to small perturbations in the population imbalance (associated with variations in ϕ) which leave n unchanged. With this parameterization, Eq. (A3) implies the coupled set of equations, ℏ2 4m∇· (n∇ϕ) = ϵκn \u0012 ¯nfv sin ϕ + λ2 2 n sin 2ϕ \u0013 , ℏ2 4m|∇ϕ|2 = ϵκ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) + n(χ −λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 , ℏ2 2m ∇2√n √n = V + \u0012 2g −κ2 + ∆2 κ \u0013 (n −¯nfv) −ϵ 2 κ2 −∆2 κ \u0002 ¯nfv(1 + cos ϕ) −n(χ + λ2 sin2 ϕ) \u0003 . (A5) By solving these equations, we can evaluate the Hamiltonian density and thereby calculate the surface tension of each interface, σi ="

    "paragraph": "false vacuum density profile at a hard wall corresponds to half of the well-known ‘dark soliton’ solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [81], joined continuously to the region of zero density beyond the wall, n(x) = ( ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x > 0, 0 if x < 0. (A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77].

(A9) The situation is the same at the true-vacuum–boundary interface, except that the bulk number density that the condensate ‘heals’ to away from the wall is enhanced by an O(ϵ) correction to offset the lower potential energy density U(ϕ). This translates into an O(ϵ) difference between the two surface tensions, σtv = σfv \u0012 ¯ntv ¯nfv \u00132 = σfv \u0012 1 + 4ϵ κ2 −∆2 2gκ −κ2 −∆2 \u0013 . (A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum.

(A10) Putting all this together, we find that the contact angle (7) between the bubble wall and the bucket trap in the thinwall limit is given by cos θ ≃−4ξ/(3λℓ) (bucket). (A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero.

(A11) Since the healing length ξ is much smaller than the bubble wall thickness ℓin the relativistic regime, this yields θ ≃ π/2 as claimed in Sec. II. In the trench case, we instead write the potential as V (x) = ( 0 if x > 0, −µv if x < 0, (trench), (A12) where µ = (2g−(κ2+∆2)/κ) ¯nfv is the chemical potential, and v > 0 is a dimensionless constant that parametrizes the depth of the trench. Solving Eq. (A3) deep inside the trench then gives n = (1 + v) ¯nfv in the false vacuum. Near the trench boundary we once again find a solution which connects part of a dark soliton to a constant density solution on the other side of the interface, n(x) = ( ¯nfv if x > 0, (1 + v) ¯nfv tanh2\u0010 (1 + v) x0−x √ 2ξ \u0011 if x < 0, (A13) where x0 is chosen to ensure continuity at x = 0. Crucially, the healing of the density occurs entirely inside the trench, i.e., in the x < 0 region. This is true of both the false-vacuum–trench interface and the true-vacuum– trench interface. At the latter there is also a phase profile, with ϕ interpolating between false vacuum in the trench and true vacuum in the bulk. The energy cost of this phase profile scales with the local number density (cf. Eq. (A7)), so the lowest-energy configuration is to have it occur entirely in the x > 0 region, where it becomes identical to a bulk bubble wall. The total surface tension at the true-vacuum–trench interface therefore separates cleanly into a density contribution from the x < 0 region, which is equal to the false-vacuum–trench tension σfv, and a phase contribution from the x > 0 region, which is   9 equal to the bubble wall tension σb. We therefore obtain σtv = σfv + σb, so that cos θ = −1 (trench), (A14) yielding θ = π as claimed in Sec. II. Note that in deriving this result we have placed no requirements on the depth v or width w of the trench, demonstrating the flexibility and generality of this approach to preventing edge nucleation. Our only implicit assumptions are that v is large enough to ensure that nucleation in the trench is strongly suppressed, and that w is large enough that the condensate can reach the enhanced density (1 + v) ¯nfv before tapering to zero. These conditions are met so long as v is not much smaller than unity, and w is at least a few times larger than the healing length. Our simulations in Sec. III use v = 1 and w = 9.75 ξ. Appendix B: Trapped initial conditions In this Appendix we describe our procedure for generating initial conditions for our truncated Wigner simulations, which approximate the initial false vacuum state of the system. It is crucial that this is done accurately, as previous work has shown that misspecifying the initial conditions can dramatically alter the nucleation rate [12]. We consider small quantum fluctuations in the atomic fields, ˆψ↓(x) = p n(r)(1 + z) + δ ˆψ↓(x), ˆψ↑(x) = − hp n(r)(1 −z) + δ ˆψ↑(x) i , (B1) where the minus sign is due to the π relative phase associated with the false vacuum. We set the population imbalance z = (1 + ϵλ2/2)∆/κ so that the total and relative phase fields decouple [13], and numerically solve for the circularly-symmetric background number density n(r) by evolving the equations of motion in imaginary time to find the ground state [77]. The total and relative fluctuations are given by the unitary transformation, δ ˆψθ = r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↓+ r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↑, δ ˆψϕ = r 1 −z 2 δ ˆψ↓− r 1 + z 2 δ ˆψ↑.

We show umn(x) with arbitrary normalization, for illustrative purposes; the corresponding vmn(x) are qualitatively very similar. Blue and red correspond to positive and negative values, respectively. where we have expanded up to quadratic order in the fluctuations δ ˆψ. Neglecting higher-order terms here corresponds to approximating the modes as non-interacting, leading to Gaussian fluctuation statistics. The operators ˆa†, ˆa are then the standard creation and annihilation operators for each mode, and are treated as i.i.d. classical random variables drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance 1/2, following the usual truncated Wigner prescription. Combining Eqs.

    "question": "How does future high-luminosity lepton colliders contribute to our understanding of high energy physics?",
    "category": "Theoretical Concept",
    "paragraph": "In order to explore production of massive states in neutrino-induced reactions, one should have at disposal high energy neutrino beams. On the other hand, as neutrino scattering experiments are usually performed in the laboratory reference frame, energy-momentum conservation results in high longitudinal momenta of the ﬁnal particles to be accurately evaluated for reconstructing the energy of an event. For this reason, the volume of a detector should be large enough to allow the particles to leave an interpretable signal in the bulk. Meeting or arranging these conditions is always a challenge for physicists and engineers [1]. This is particularly the case of searches for the Glashow resonance – annihilation of an electron antineutrino with an electron into an on-shell W −boson, ¯νee−→W −. The existence of this resonant process had been predicted by the theoretical physicist Sheldon Glashow in 1959 [2] but still lacks unambiguous experimental conﬁrmation [3, 4]. Meanwhile, its discovery would provide an additional important test of the Standard Model (to simplify the terminology, we write “neutrino beam”, “neutrino energy”, etc., frequently implying also antineutrino). To produce a state as heavy as W −(mW ≂80.3 GeV) in scattering with electrons at rest, the incident neutrino energy must be very high, about 6.3 × 1015 eV (6.3 PeV) [5]. The only available source of such energetic particles is cosmic rays. However, the relatively low intensity of the astrophysical neutrino beam requires signiﬁcant observation times, even at kilometerscale telescopes like IceCube [6], Baikal-GVD [7] or KM3NeT [8]. Thus, after over a decade of searches, IceCube has recorded only a few neutrino events with PeV energies [3, 9, 10]. Of these, one shower appeared in the vicinity of the resonance, having an energy of 6.05 ± 0.72 PeV [3]. The candidate events should not, of course, necessarily fall into the energy bins close to the resonance peak. Being directly related to the ﬂavor composition and the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos [11, 12], the events in principle can have energies of about 1−2 PeV [13–15]. Various implications of the detection of the Glashow resonance as well as the expected signatures have been extensively studied (e.g. in [16–23]). Nevertheless, conclusive support for this long-standing prediction is yet to be found. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow resonance that would not necessitate having initial neutrino beams? We suggest a surprisingly positive answer to this question – namely, that the process may proceed in electron–positron collisions at accelerator energies, occurring, for instance, as e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Although the resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent, quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of ρ+ from the initial state converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. Likewise, the CP conjugate channel, νee+ →W +, takes the form e+e−→W +ρ(770)−. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance. This is in contrast to the settled opinion attributing the principal obstacle to observing the resonance in laboratories to the limited energies attainable by terrestrial accelerators. The suggested reactions might occur already at total energies of order 100 GeV in the center-of-mass (cms) frame.

    "paragraph": "In order to explore production of massive states in neutrino-induced reactions, one should have at disposal high energy neutrino beams. On the other hand, as neutrino scattering experiments are usually performed in the laboratory reference frame, energy-momentum conservation results in high longitudinal momenta of the ﬁnal particles to be accurately evaluated for reconstructing the energy of an event. For this reason, the volume of a detector should be large enough to allow the particles to leave an interpretable signal in the bulk. Meeting or arranging these conditions is always a challenge for physicists and engineers [1]. This is particularly the case of searches for the Glashow resonance – annihilation of an electron antineutrino with an electron into an on-shell W −boson, ¯νee−→W −. The existence of this resonant process had been predicted by the theoretical physicist Sheldon Glashow in 1959 [2] but still lacks unambiguous experimental conﬁrmation [3, 4]. Meanwhile, its discovery would provide an additional important test of the Standard Model (to simplify the terminology, we write “neutrino beam”, “neutrino energy”, etc., frequently implying also antineutrino). To produce a state as heavy as W −(mW ≂80.3 GeV) in scattering with electrons at rest, the incident neutrino energy must be very high, about 6.3 × 1015 eV (6.3 PeV) [5]. The only available source of such energetic particles is cosmic rays. However, the relatively low intensity of the astrophysical neutrino beam requires signiﬁcant observation times, even at kilometerscale telescopes like IceCube [6], Baikal-GVD [7] or KM3NeT [8]. Thus, after over a decade of searches, IceCube has recorded only a few neutrino events with PeV energies [3, 9, 10]. Of these, one shower appeared in the vicinity of the resonance, having an energy of 6.05 ± 0.72 PeV [3]. The candidate events should not, of course, necessarily fall into the energy bins close to the resonance peak. Being directly related to the ﬂavor composition and the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos [11, 12], the events in principle can have energies of about 1−2 PeV [13–15]. Various implications of the detection of the Glashow resonance as well as the expected signatures have been extensively studied (e.g. in [16–23]). Nevertheless, conclusive support for this long-standing prediction is yet to be found. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow resonance that would not necessitate having initial neutrino beams? We suggest a surprisingly positive answer to this question – namely, that the process may proceed in electron–positron collisions at accelerator energies, occurring, for instance, as e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Although the resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent, quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of ρ+ from the initial state converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. Likewise, the CP conjugate channel, νee+ →W +, takes the form e+e−→W +ρ(770)−. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance. This is in contrast to the settled opinion attributing the principal obstacle to observing the resonance in laboratories to the limited energies attainable by terrestrial accelerators. The suggested reactions might occur already at total energies of order 100 GeV in the center-of-mass (cms) frame.

    "paragraph": "In order to explore production of massive states in neutrino-induced reactions, one should have at disposal high energy neutrino beams. On the other hand, as neutrino scattering experiments are usually performed in the laboratory reference frame, energy-momentum conservation results in high longitudinal momenta of the ﬁnal particles to be accurately evaluated for reconstructing the energy of an event. For this reason, the volume of a detector should be large enough to allow the particles to leave an interpretable signal in the bulk. Meeting or arranging these conditions is always a challenge for physicists and engineers [1]. This is particularly the case of searches for the Glashow resonance – annihilation of an electron antineutrino with an electron into an on-shell W −boson, ¯νee−→W −. The existence of this resonant process had been predicted by the theoretical physicist Sheldon Glashow in 1959 [2] but still lacks unambiguous experimental conﬁrmation [3, 4]. Meanwhile, its discovery would provide an additional important test of the Standard Model (to simplify the terminology, we write “neutrino beam”, “neutrino energy”, etc., frequently implying also antineutrino). To produce a state as heavy as W −(mW ≂80.3 GeV) in scattering with electrons at rest, the incident neutrino energy must be very high, about 6.3 × 1015 eV (6.3 PeV) [5]. The only available source of such energetic particles is cosmic rays. However, the relatively low intensity of the astrophysical neutrino beam requires signiﬁcant observation times, even at kilometerscale telescopes like IceCube [6], Baikal-GVD [7] or KM3NeT [8]. Thus, after over a decade of searches, IceCube has recorded only a few neutrino events with PeV energies [3, 9, 10]. Of these, one shower appeared in the vicinity of the resonance, having an energy of 6.05 ± 0.72 PeV [3]. The candidate events should not, of course, necessarily fall into the energy bins close to the resonance peak. Being directly related to the ﬂavor composition and the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos [11, 12], the events in principle can have energies of about 1−2 PeV [13–15]. Various implications of the detection of the Glashow resonance as well as the expected signatures have been extensively studied (e.g. in [16–23]). Nevertheless, conclusive support for this long-standing prediction is yet to be found.

The candidate events should not, of course, necessarily fall into the energy bins close to the resonance peak. Being directly related to the ﬂavor composition and the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos [11, 12], the events in principle can have energies of about 1−2 PeV [13–15]. Various implications of the detection of the Glashow resonance as well as the expected signatures have been extensively studied (e.g. in [16–23]). Nevertheless, conclusive support for this long-standing prediction is yet to be found. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow resonance that would not necessitate having initial neutrino beams? We suggest a surprisingly positive answer to this question – namely, that the process may proceed in electron–positron collisions at accelerator energies, occurring, for instance, as e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Although the resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent, quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of ρ+ from the initial state converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. Likewise, the CP conjugate channel, νee+ →W +, takes the form e+e−→W +ρ(770)−. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance. This is in contrast to the settled opinion attributing the principal obstacle to observing the resonance in laboratories to the limited energies attainable by terrestrial accelerators. The suggested reactions might occur already at total energies of order 100 GeV in the center-of-mass (cms) frame. The idea of accessing the resonance with charged lepton beams had also been addressed in [24, 25]. The article is organized as follows. In Section II we outline the mechanism of initial state radiation by focusing on a speciﬁc example of excitation of a narrow res  2 onance. In Section III we elaborate the meson analogue of the radiative return and apply it to show the presence of the resonance in reactions like e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Section IV contains a discussion of accessibility of the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance and its muon copy to experimental study. In Section V we analyze possible non-resonant channels. Section VI presents our numerical estimates of the event rates expected at future lepton collides and shortly describes the details of calculations. Finally, conclusions and some general comments are given in Section VII. II."

As a speciﬁc example, let us consider electron–positron annihilation into the Z boson, e+e−→Z. This annihilation is frequently accompanied by photon emission, e+e−→Zγ, (1) which distorts the Z line shape [26]. The underlying physics becomes especially transparent in the framework of the equivalent particle approximation [27]. Even if the initial total energy of the collision is higher than the Z boson mass, s > m2 Z, the energy excess is carried away by the emitted photon, thus turning the e+e−pair to the resonance pole [28]. This gives raise to the so called radiative tail – a widening of the resonance to the right of its peak. The possibility of “tuning” the e+e−collision energy by ISR is the basis of the radiative return [29]. Using the language of the quark–parton model [30, 31], one can derive the probability density of ﬁnding a positron with energy fraction x in the parent positron [27].

In the leading order it is of the form Fe/e(x, Q2) = e2 8π2 1 + x2 1 −x ln \u0012 Q2 m2e \u0013 , (2) where e = √ 4πα is the elementary electric charge, Q2 is four-momentum transfer squared, me is the electron mass. This result is a direct consequence of the QED photon coupling to the positron current with the matrix element MQED = e [¯veγσve] ε∗ σ. (3) The corresponding diagram is shown in Fig. 1(a). By CP symmetry, exactly the same distribution holds for the electron. Details of derivation of (2) can be found in textbooks, e.g. in [32]. The cross section for process (1) is represented as the following integral [29]: σee→Zγ(s) = 2 Z Fe/e(x, s) σee→Z(xs) dx. (4) FIG. 1.

The arrows sketch the spatial momentum ﬂows. Here σee→Z(s) is the cross section for the annihilation e+e−→Z, the factor of 2 takes into account the possibility that either initial lepton can radiate the photon. Note that the simple kinematics of the process gives Q2 = s in the high energy limit. It is crucial that not only the photon but also the leptons can be regarded massless in comparison with the Z boson mass. An additional insight into the described mechanism may be provided by the diagram in Fig. 1(b). Using the narrow width approximation, σee→Z(s) = 12π2ΓZ→eeδ(s −m2 Z)/mZ, one can check [33] that the integration (4) yields exactly the leading order result [34] of straightforward electroweak calculations of the cross section. In the latter expression, ΓZ→ee is the width of the Z →e+e−decay channel, δ(x) is the Dirac delta function. The representation considered allows us to see analytically the presence of the resonance. Even though there are two particles in the ﬁnal state, Zγ, instead of a single Z, we still deal with the resonant production of the boson through e+e−→Z.

    "paragraph": "To lay the groundwork for the subsequent analysis, in this section we outline a well known eﬀect in quantum electrodynamics (QED) – initial state radiation (ISR). As a speciﬁc example, let us consider electron–positron annihilation into the Z boson, e+e−→Z. This annihilation is frequently accompanied by photon emission, e+e−→Zγ, (1) which distorts the Z line shape [26]. The underlying physics becomes especially transparent in the framework of the equivalent particle approximation [27]. Even if the initial total energy of the collision is higher than the Z boson mass, s > m2 Z, the energy excess is carried away by the emitted photon, thus turning the e+e−pair to the resonance pole [28]. This gives raise to the so called radiative tail – a widening of the resonance to the right of its peak. The possibility of “tuning” the e+e−collision energy by ISR is the basis of the radiative return [29]. Using the language of the quark–parton model [30, 31], one can derive the probability density of ﬁnding a positron with energy fraction x in the parent positron [27].

    "paragraph": "The Standard Model admits eﬀective couplings of charged vector mesons to the leptonic currents. They had been known long ago and even entered textbooks [35]. Such an interaction of the ρ(770)+ meson is represented graphically in Fig. 1(c). The coupling opens, for example, channels for the mesons to decay into lepton pairs ν (–) l l∓[36]. Inverse processes, with the produc  3 tion of ρ(770)± in lepton–lepton scattering, are also allowed [37, 38]. Henceforth, the symbol ρ± will stand for the meson state ρ(770)±. As illustrated by Fig. 1(d), the eﬀective coupling eνρ also gives rise to the following reaction: e+e−→W −ρ+. (5) The apparent similarity between the diagrams in Figs. 1(b) and 1(d) suggests that here we may have a mechanism resembling ISR. As will be seen, this interpretation is tenable. From the kinematical point of view, the subprocesses in Figs. 1(a) and 1(c) are equivalent at high energies since it becomes fair to neglect the meson mass. Therefore, by analogy with (2), we introduce a distribution of electron antineutrinos in the positron. The vertex eνρ in Fig. 1(c) gives a matrix element (see, e.g., [36]) Meﬀective = GF √ 2 Vud fρ mρ \u0002 ¯veγσ(1 −γ5)vν \u0003 ǫ∗ σ, (6) where GF is the Fermi coupling constant, Vud is the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix element between the u and d quarks, fρ is the decay constant of the meson parametrizing the hadronic part of the amplitude and mρ is the mass of the meson. The polarization vector ǫσ satisﬁes the standard summation P polarizations ǫλǫ∗ σ = − \u0000gλσ −pλpσ/m2 ρ \u0001 with p being the four-momentum of the meson. Simple calculations (almost the same as those in QED described above) yield the probability density of ﬁnding an electron antineutrino with energy fraction x in the parent positron: F (ρ) ν/e(x, Q2) = (GρGF )2 8π2 1 + x2 1 −x ln \u0012 Q2 m2ρ \u0013 . (7) Here we have written Gρ as a shorthand for the product |Vud|fρmρ. The superscript (ρ) on F labels the meson whose emission yields the distribution. Note that fρ has units of energy, so that GρGF is dimensionless. CP symmetry and lepton universality are assumed throughout. The similarity between (7) and (2) is evident, as could be anticipated from the kinematics. We therefore suggest an interpretation analogous to the radiative return −namely, that reaction (5) may proceed via initial state meson emission. The crucial subtlety is that the emission of ρ+ not merely carries away the energy excess but converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. The latter annihilates with the electron into the ﬁnal W −. In other words, the Glashow resonance might occur as e+e−→W −ρ+. As in (4), the presence of the resonance becomes analytically explicit in the partonic representation of the corresponding cross section: σee→Wρ(s) = Z F (ρ) ν/e(x, s) σνe→W (xs) dx, (8) where σνe→W (s) is the cross section for ¯νee−→W −. We again have taken into account that here Q2 = s in the high energy limit. The integral reminds us of the description of a Drell–Yan process in which one of the two projectiles remains on-shell (electron) and annihilates with partons (antineutrinos) distributed with some density F in the other projectile (positron). The factorization in (8) is justiﬁed as long as s ≫m2 ρ. Within the narrow width approximation, which gives σνe→W (s) = √ 8π2GF m2 W δ(s −m2 W ), we ﬁnd that σee→Wρ(s) = G2 ρG3 F √ 8π2 r + r3 1 −r ln \u0012 s m2ρ \u0013 , (9) where r = m2 W /s. It may be instructive to write the result also as σee→Wρ(s) = √ 8π2GF rF (ρ) ν/e(r, s). The cross section turns out to be proportional to the antineutrino distribution in the positron. Projecting out a parton distribution in a cross section is a general indicator of excitation of a narrow resonance [27]. In our case, the ratio of the total width of W −to its mass is ≂1/40 such that the assumption about the relative narrowness of the Glashow resonance is acceptable. The same situation, by the way, occurs for e+e−→Zγ. One can verify that its leading order cross section [34] is a projection of the QED electron distribution Fe/e(x, s). As may be already obvious, the discussed mechanism is realizable not only with ρ±, but also with a relatively wide set of scalar and vector particles (not necessarily onshell) provided: (i) they couple to the electroweak currents; (ii) their squared four-momenta are much smaller compared to those of the produced ﬁnal states. In general, the process will have the form: e+e−→W −h+, where h+ is any allowed state satisfying the above conditions. For example, from the kinematical point of view, a favourable reaction to excite the Glashow resonance would be e+e−→W −π+ due to the smallness of the pion mass, but its probability is helicity-suppressed. This is the reason we have chosen the ρ meson to illustrate the resonant mechanism. It is a vector particle, free from the helicity-suppression and, in addition, relatively light. On the other hand, dealing with the speciﬁc familiar charged meson, our discussion is not abstract. Another promising channel may be e+e−→W −D∗+ s , where D∗+ s is the meson of mass mD∗s = 2112.2 MeV with explicitly nonzero quantum numbers of charm and strangeness, C = S = 1 [39]. The width and decay modes of D∗± s are consistent with the spin-parity JP = 1−. Its coupling to the leptonic weak current is favoured by the CKM element |Vcs|. IV."

    "paragraph": "The Standard Model admits eﬀective couplings of charged vector mesons to the leptonic currents. They had been known long ago and even entered textbooks [35]. Such an interaction of the ρ(770)+ meson is represented graphically in Fig. 1(c). The coupling opens, for example, channels for the mesons to decay into lepton pairs ν (–) l l∓[36]. Inverse processes, with the produc  3 tion of ρ(770)± in lepton–lepton scattering, are also allowed [37, 38]. Henceforth, the symbol ρ± will stand for the meson state ρ(770)±. As illustrated by Fig. 1(d), the eﬀective coupling eνρ also gives rise to the following reaction: e+e−→W −ρ+. (5) The apparent similarity between the diagrams in Figs. 1(b) and 1(d) suggests that here we may have a mechanism resembling ISR. As will be seen, this interpretation is tenable. From the kinematical point of view, the subprocesses in Figs. 1(a) and 1(c) are equivalent at high energies since it becomes fair to neglect the meson mass. Therefore, by analogy with (2), we introduce a distribution of electron antineutrinos in the positron. The vertex eνρ in Fig. 1(c) gives a matrix element (see, e.g., [36]) Meﬀective = GF √ 2 Vud fρ mρ \u0002 ¯veγσ(1 −γ5)vν \u0003 ǫ∗ σ, (6) where GF is the Fermi coupling constant, Vud is the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix element between the u and d quarks, fρ is the decay constant of the meson parametrizing the hadronic part of the amplitude and mρ is the mass of the meson. The polarization vector ǫσ satisﬁes the standard summation P polarizations ǫλǫ∗ σ = − \u0000gλσ −pλpσ/m2 ρ \u0001 with p being the four-momentum of the meson. Simple calculations (almost the same as those in QED described above) yield the probability density of ﬁnding an electron antineutrino with energy fraction x in the parent positron: F (ρ) ν/e(x, Q2) = (GρGF )2 8π2 1 + x2 1 −x ln \u0012 Q2 m2ρ \u0013 . (7) Here we have written Gρ as a shorthand for the product |Vud|fρmρ. The superscript (ρ) on F labels the meson whose emission yields the distribution. Note that fρ has units of energy, so that GρGF is dimensionless. CP symmetry and lepton universality are assumed throughout. The similarity between (7) and (2) is evident, as could be anticipated from the kinematics. We therefore suggest an interpretation analogous to the radiative return −namely, that reaction (5) may proceed via initial state meson emission. The crucial subtlety is that the emission of ρ+ not merely carries away the energy excess but converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. The latter annihilates with the electron into the ﬁnal W −. In other words, the Glashow resonance might occur as e+e−→W −ρ+. As in (4), the presence of the resonance becomes analytically explicit in the partonic representation of the corresponding cross section: σee→Wρ(s) = Z F (ρ) ν/e(x, s) σνe→W (xs) dx, (8) where σνe→W (s) is the cross section for ¯νee−→W −. We again have taken into account that here Q2 = s in the high energy limit. The integral reminds us of the description of a Drell–Yan process in which one of the two projectiles remains on-shell (electron) and annihilates with partons (antineutrinos) distributed with some density F in the other projectile (positron). The factorization in (8) is justiﬁed as long as s ≫m2 ρ. Within the narrow width approximation, which gives σνe→W (s) = √ 8π2GF m2 W δ(s −m2 W ), we ﬁnd that σee→Wρ(s) = G2 ρG3 F √ 8π2 r + r3 1 −r ln \u0012 s m2ρ \u0013 , (9) where r = m2 W /s. It may be instructive to write the result also as σee→Wρ(s) = √ 8π2GF rF (ρ) ν/e(r, s). The cross section turns out to be proportional to the antineutrino distribution in the positron. Projecting out a parton distribution in a cross section is a general indicator of excitation of a narrow resonance [27]. In our case, the ratio of the total width of W −to its mass is ≂1/40 such that the assumption about the relative narrowness of the Glashow resonance is acceptable. The same situation, by the way, occurs for e+e−→Zγ. One can verify that its leading order cross section [34] is a projection of the QED electron distribution Fe/e(x, s). As may be already obvious, the discussed mechanism is realizable not only with ρ±, but also with a relatively wide set of scalar and vector particles (not necessarily onshell) provided: (i) they couple to the electroweak currents; (ii) their squared four-momenta are much smaller compared to those of the produced ﬁnal states. In general, the process will have the form: e+e−→W −h+, where h+ is any allowed state satisfying the above conditions. For example, from the kinematical point of view, a favourable reaction to excite the Glashow resonance would be e+e−→W −π+ due to the smallness of the pion mass, but its probability is helicity-suppressed. This is the reason we have chosen the ρ meson to illustrate the resonant mechanism. It is a vector particle, free from the helicity-suppression and, in addition, relatively light. On the other hand, dealing with the speciﬁc familiar charged meson, our discussion is not abstract. Another promising channel may be e+e−→W −D∗+ s , where D∗+ s is the meson of mass mD∗s = 2112.2 MeV with explicitly nonzero quantum numbers of charm and strangeness, C = S = 1 [39]. The width and decay modes of D∗± s are consistent with the spin-parity JP = 1−. Its coupling to the leptonic weak current is favoured by the CKM element |Vcs|. IV."

Such an interaction of the ρ(770)+ meson is represented graphically in Fig. 1(c). The coupling opens, for example, channels for the mesons to decay into lepton pairs ν (–) l l∓[36]. Inverse processes, with the produc  3 tion of ρ(770)± in lepton–lepton scattering, are also allowed [37, 38]. Henceforth, the symbol ρ± will stand for the meson state ρ(770)±. As illustrated by Fig. 1(d), the eﬀective coupling eνρ also gives rise to the following reaction: e+e−→W −ρ+. (5) The apparent similarity between the diagrams in Figs. 1(b) and 1(d) suggests that here we may have a mechanism resembling ISR. As will be seen, this interpretation is tenable. From the kinematical point of view, the subprocesses in Figs. 1(a) and 1(c) are equivalent at high energies since it becomes fair to neglect the meson mass. Therefore, by analogy with (2), we introduce a distribution of electron antineutrinos in the positron. The vertex eνρ in Fig. 1(c) gives a matrix element (see, e.g., [36]) Meﬀective = GF √ 2 Vud fρ mρ \u0002 ¯veγσ(1 −γ5)vν \u0003 ǫ∗ σ, (6) where GF is the Fermi coupling constant, Vud is the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix element between the u and d quarks, fρ is the decay constant of the meson parametrizing the hadronic part of the amplitude and mρ is the mass of the meson. The polarization vector ǫσ satisﬁes the standard summation P polarizations ǫλǫ∗ σ = − \u0000gλσ −pλpσ/m2 ρ \u0001 with p being the four-momentum of the meson. Simple calculations (almost the same as those in QED described above) yield the probability density of ﬁnding an electron antineutrino with energy fraction x in the parent positron: F (ρ) ν/e(x, Q2) = (GρGF )2 8π2 1 + x2 1 −x ln \u0012 Q2 m2ρ \u0013 . (7) Here we have written Gρ as a shorthand for the product |Vud|fρmρ. The superscript (ρ) on F labels the meson whose emission yields the distribution. Note that fρ has units of energy, so that GρGF is dimensionless. CP symmetry and lepton universality are assumed throughout. The similarity between (7) and (2) is evident, as could be anticipated from the kinematics. We therefore suggest an interpretation analogous to the radiative return −namely, that reaction (5) may proceed via initial state meson emission. The crucial subtlety is that the emission of ρ+ not merely carries away the energy excess but converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. The latter annihilates with the electron into the ﬁnal W −. In other words, the Glashow resonance might occur as e+e−→W −ρ+. As in (4), the presence of the resonance becomes analytically explicit in the partonic representation of the corresponding cross section: σee→Wρ(s) = Z F (ρ) ν/e(x, s) σνe→W (xs) dx, (8) where σνe→W (s) is the cross section for ¯νee−→W −. We again have taken into account that here Q2 = s in the high energy limit. The integral reminds us of the description of a Drell–Yan process in which one of the two projectiles remains on-shell (electron) and annihilates with partons (antineutrinos) distributed with some density F in the other projectile (positron). The factorization in (8) is justiﬁed as long as s ≫m2 ρ. Within the narrow width approximation, which gives σνe→W (s) = √ 8π2GF m2 W δ(s −m2 W ), we ﬁnd that σee→Wρ(s) = G2 ρG3 F √ 8π2 r + r3 1 −r ln \u0012 s m2ρ \u0013 , (9) where r = m2 W /s. It may be instructive to write the result also as σee→Wρ(s) = √ 8π2GF rF (ρ) ν/e(r, s). The cross section turns out to be proportional to the antineutrino distribution in the positron. Projecting out a parton distribution in a cross section is a general indicator of excitation of a narrow resonance [27]. In our case, the ratio of the total width of W −to its mass is ≂1/40 such that the assumption about the relative narrowness of the Glashow resonance is acceptable. The same situation, by the way, occurs for e+e−→Zγ. One can verify that its leading order cross section [34] is a projection of the QED electron distribution Fe/e(x, s). As may be already obvious, the discussed mechanism is realizable not only with ρ±, but also with a relatively wide set of scalar and vector particles (not necessarily onshell) provided: (i) they couple to the electroweak currents; (ii) their squared four-momenta are much smaller compared to those of the produced ﬁnal states. In general, the process will have the form: e+e−→W −h+, where h+ is any allowed state satisfying the above conditions. For example, from the kinematical point of view, a favourable reaction to excite the Glashow resonance would be e+e−→W −π+ due to the smallness of the pion mass, but its probability is helicity-suppressed. This is the reason we have chosen the ρ meson to illustrate the resonant mechanism. It is a vector particle, free from the helicity-suppression and, in addition, relatively light. On the other hand, dealing with the speciﬁc familiar charged meson, our discussion is not abstract. Another promising channel may be e+e−→W −D∗+ s , where D∗+ s is the meson of mass mD∗s = 2112.2 MeV with explicitly nonzero quantum numbers of charm and strangeness, C = S = 1 [39].

Such an interaction of the ρ(770)+ meson is represented graphically in Fig. 1(c). The coupling opens, for example, channels for the mesons to decay into lepton pairs ν (–) l l∓[36]. Inverse processes, with the produc  3 tion of ρ(770)± in lepton–lepton scattering, are also allowed [37, 38]. Henceforth, the symbol ρ± will stand for the meson state ρ(770)±. As illustrated by Fig. 1(d), the eﬀective coupling eνρ also gives rise to the following reaction: e+e−→W −ρ+. (5) The apparent similarity between the diagrams in Figs. 1(b) and 1(d) suggests that here we may have a mechanism resembling ISR. As will be seen, this interpretation is tenable. From the kinematical point of view, the subprocesses in Figs. 1(a) and 1(c) are equivalent at high energies since it becomes fair to neglect the meson mass. Therefore, by analogy with (2), we introduce a distribution of electron antineutrinos in the positron. The vertex eνρ in Fig. 1(c) gives a matrix element (see, e.g., [36]) Meﬀective = GF √ 2 Vud fρ mρ \u0002 ¯veγσ(1 −γ5)vν \u0003 ǫ∗ σ, (6) where GF is the Fermi coupling constant, Vud is the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix element between the u and d quarks, fρ is the decay constant of the meson parametrizing the hadronic part of the amplitude and mρ is the mass of the meson. The polarization vector ǫσ satisﬁes the standard summation P polarizations ǫλǫ∗ σ = − \u0000gλσ −pλpσ/m2 ρ \u0001 with p being the four-momentum of the meson. Simple calculations (almost the same as those in QED described above) yield the probability density of ﬁnding an electron antineutrino with energy fraction x in the parent positron: F (ρ) ν/e(x, Q2) = (GρGF )2 8π2 1 + x2 1 −x ln \u0012 Q2 m2ρ \u0013 . (7) Here we have written Gρ as a shorthand for the product |Vud|fρmρ. The superscript (ρ) on F labels the meson whose emission yields the distribution. Note that fρ has units of energy, so that GρGF is dimensionless. CP symmetry and lepton universality are assumed throughout. The similarity between (7) and (2) is evident, as could be anticipated from the kinematics. We therefore suggest an interpretation analogous to the radiative return −namely, that reaction (5) may proceed via initial state meson emission. The crucial subtlety is that the emission of ρ+ not merely carries away the energy excess but converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. The latter annihilates with the electron into the ﬁnal W −. In other words, the Glashow resonance might occur as e+e−→W −ρ+. As in (4), the presence of the resonance becomes analytically explicit in the partonic representation of the corresponding cross section: σee→Wρ(s) = Z F (ρ) ν/e(x, s) σνe→W (xs) dx, (8) where σνe→W (s) is the cross section for ¯νee−→W −. We again have taken into account that here Q2 = s in the high energy limit. The integral reminds us of the description of a Drell–Yan process in which one of the two projectiles remains on-shell (electron) and annihilates with partons (antineutrinos) distributed with some density F in the other projectile (positron). The factorization in (8) is justiﬁed as long as s ≫m2 ρ. Within the narrow width approximation, which gives σνe→W (s) = √ 8π2GF m2 W δ(s −m2 W ), we ﬁnd that σee→Wρ(s) = G2 ρG3 F √ 8π2 r + r3 1 −r ln \u0012 s m2ρ \u0013 , (9) where r = m2 W /s. It may be instructive to write the result also as σee→Wρ(s) = √ 8π2GF rF (ρ) ν/e(r, s). The cross section turns out to be proportional to the antineutrino distribution in the positron. Projecting out a parton distribution in a cross section is a general indicator of excitation of a narrow resonance [27]. In our case, the ratio of the total width of W −to its mass is ≂1/40 such that the assumption about the relative narrowness of the Glashow resonance is acceptable. The same situation, by the way, occurs for e+e−→Zγ. One can verify that its leading order cross section [34] is a projection of the QED electron distribution Fe/e(x, s). As may be already obvious, the discussed mechanism is realizable not only with ρ±, but also with a relatively wide set of scalar and vector particles (not necessarily onshell) provided: (i) they couple to the electroweak currents; (ii) their squared four-momenta are much smaller compared to those of the produced ﬁnal states. In general, the process will have the form: e+e−→W −h+, where h+ is any allowed state satisfying the above conditions. For example, from the kinematical point of view, a favourable reaction to excite the Glashow resonance would be e+e−→W −π+ due to the smallness of the pion mass, but its probability is helicity-suppressed. This is the reason we have chosen the ρ meson to illustrate the resonant mechanism. It is a vector particle, free from the helicity-suppression and, in addition, relatively light. On the other hand, dealing with the speciﬁc familiar charged meson, our discussion is not abstract. Another promising channel may be e+e−→W −D∗+ s , where D∗+ s is the meson of mass mD∗s = 2112.2 MeV with explicitly nonzero quantum numbers of charm and strangeness, C = S = 1 [39]. The width and decay modes of D∗± s are consistent with the spin-parity JP = 1−. Its coupling to the leptonic weak current is favoured by the CKM element |Vcs|. IV."

Inverse processes, with the produc  3 tion of ρ(770)± in lepton–lepton scattering, are also allowed [37, 38]. Henceforth, the symbol ρ± will stand for the meson state ρ(770)±. As illustrated by Fig. 1(d), the eﬀective coupling eνρ also gives rise to the following reaction: e+e−→W −ρ+. (5) The apparent similarity between the diagrams in Figs. 1(b) and 1(d) suggests that here we may have a mechanism resembling ISR. As will be seen, this interpretation is tenable. From the kinematical point of view, the subprocesses in Figs. 1(a) and 1(c) are equivalent at high energies since it becomes fair to neglect the meson mass. Therefore, by analogy with (2), we introduce a distribution of electron antineutrinos in the positron. The vertex eνρ in Fig. 1(c) gives a matrix element (see, e.g., [36]) Meﬀective = GF √ 2 Vud fρ mρ \u0002 ¯veγσ(1 −γ5)vν \u0003 ǫ∗ σ, (6) where GF is the Fermi coupling constant, Vud is the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix element between the u and d quarks, fρ is the decay constant of the meson parametrizing the hadronic part of the amplitude and mρ is the mass of the meson. The polarization vector ǫσ satisﬁes the standard summation P polarizations ǫλǫ∗ σ = − \u0000gλσ −pλpσ/m2 ρ \u0001 with p being the four-momentum of the meson. Simple calculations (almost the same as those in QED described above) yield the probability density of ﬁnding an electron antineutrino with energy fraction x in the parent positron: F (ρ) ν/e(x, Q2) = (GρGF )2 8π2 1 + x2 1 −x ln \u0012 Q2 m2ρ \u0013 . (7) Here we have written Gρ as a shorthand for the product |Vud|fρmρ. The superscript (ρ) on F labels the meson whose emission yields the distribution. Note that fρ has units of energy, so that GρGF is dimensionless. CP symmetry and lepton universality are assumed throughout. The similarity between (7) and (2) is evident, as could be anticipated from the kinematics. We therefore suggest an interpretation analogous to the radiative return −namely, that reaction (5) may proceed via initial state meson emission. The crucial subtlety is that the emission of ρ+ not merely carries away the energy excess but converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. The latter annihilates with the electron into the ﬁnal W −. In other words, the Glashow resonance might occur as e+e−→W −ρ+. As in (4), the presence of the resonance becomes analytically explicit in the partonic representation of the corresponding cross section: σee→Wρ(s) = Z F (ρ) ν/e(x, s) σνe→W (xs) dx, (8) where σνe→W (s) is the cross section for ¯νee−→W −. We again have taken into account that here Q2 = s in the high energy limit. The integral reminds us of the description of a Drell–Yan process in which one of the two projectiles remains on-shell (electron) and annihilates with partons (antineutrinos) distributed with some density F in the other projectile (positron). The factorization in (8) is justiﬁed as long as s ≫m2 ρ. Within the narrow width approximation, which gives σνe→W (s) = √ 8π2GF m2 W δ(s −m2 W ), we ﬁnd that σee→Wρ(s) = G2 ρG3 F √ 8π2 r + r3 1 −r ln \u0012 s m2ρ \u0013 , (9) where r = m2 W /s. It may be instructive to write the result also as σee→Wρ(s) = √ 8π2GF rF (ρ) ν/e(r, s). The cross section turns out to be proportional to the antineutrino distribution in the positron. Projecting out a parton distribution in a cross section is a general indicator of excitation of a narrow resonance [27]. In our case, the ratio of the total width of W −to its mass is ≂1/40 such that the assumption about the relative narrowness of the Glashow resonance is acceptable. The same situation, by the way, occurs for e+e−→Zγ. One can verify that its leading order cross section [34] is a projection of the QED electron distribution Fe/e(x, s). As may be already obvious, the discussed mechanism is realizable not only with ρ±, but also with a relatively wide set of scalar and vector particles (not necessarily onshell) provided: (i) they couple to the electroweak currents; (ii) their squared four-momenta are much smaller compared to those of the produced ﬁnal states. In general, the process will have the form: e+e−→W −h+, where h+ is any allowed state satisfying the above conditions. For example, from the kinematical point of view, a favourable reaction to excite the Glashow resonance would be e+e−→W −π+ due to the smallness of the pion mass, but its probability is helicity-suppressed. This is the reason we have chosen the ρ meson to illustrate the resonant mechanism. It is a vector particle, free from the helicity-suppression and, in addition, relatively light. On the other hand, dealing with the speciﬁc familiar charged meson, our discussion is not abstract. Another promising channel may be e+e−→W −D∗+ s , where D∗+ s is the meson of mass mD∗s = 2112.2 MeV with explicitly nonzero quantum numbers of charm and strangeness, C = S = 1 [39]. The width and decay modes of D∗± s are consistent with the spin-parity JP = 1−. Its coupling to the leptonic weak current is favoured by the CKM element |Vcs|. IV."

The distributions are the QED analogues of those for the quarks and gluons such that accurately computable by well-developed methods. One thus could exploit atomic nuclei as sources of positrons and muons to get access to the channels like ν (–) le+ →X and ν (–) lµ± →X′ producing massive ﬁnal states X [40, 41]. This is closely related to the ability of photons to split into l+l−pairs [27, 42, 43] in interactions with neutrinos [44, 45]. On the other hand, as was discussed in the previous section, one can introduce a neutrino distribution in the electron. By lepton universality, the same result holds for muons as well. This makes it in principle possible to test both the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance and its copy for the second generation of leptons via the reactions e+e−→W +ρ−, µ+µ−→W ∓ρ± for which the diagrams are shown in Fig. 2. In the Standard Model, their cross sections coincide at high energies, being given by (9). V."

    "paragraph": "Usually, neither the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance, νee+ → W +, nor its copy for muons, ¯νµµ−→ W −, is discussed in the literature. Meanwhile, these channels are also signiﬁcant predictions of   4 the Standard Model still requiring experimental veriﬁcation. The latter would furnish important support for CP symmetry and lepton universality in the neutrino sector of the Standard Model. At ﬁrst glance, the channels seem to be inaccessible to experimental study because the problem is complicated by the need to arrange collisions of neutrinos with positrons or muons. A way out of this diﬃculty might be invoking the method of equivalent particles. For example, it has been known that with each electrically charged particle one can associate distributions of charged leptons, e±, µ± and, in some cases, even τ ± [27].

The possible leading order background can in general be represented by two s-channel Feynman diagrams with γ and Z exchanges as shown in Fig. 3. For completeness, one could also add a similar graph with an intermediate Higgs boson, but we ignore it. In principle, the vertices γWρ and ZWρ may arise in eﬀective theories like vector meson dominance extended to weak interactions [46].

    "paragraph": "North-Caucasus Center for Mathematical Research, North-Caucasus Federal University, Stavropol 355017, Russia The s-channel process ¯νee−→W −(on-shell) is now referred to as the Glashow resonance and being searched for at kilometer-scale neutrino ice/water detectors like IceCube, Baikal-GVD or KM3NeT. After over a decade of observations, IceCube has recorded only a few relevant neutrino events such that further exploration yet remains necessary for unambiguous conﬁrmation of the existence of this resonant interaction. Meanwhile, its experimental discovery would provide an additional important test of the Standard Model. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow resonance that would not necessitate having initial (anti)neutrino beams? This article suggests a surprisingly positive answer to the question – namely, that the process may proceed in electron–positron collisions at accelerator energies, occurring as e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Although the resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent, quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of ρ+ from the initial state converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. Likewise, the CP conjugate channel, νee+ →W +, takes the form e+e−→W +ρ(770)−. Similar reactions with muons are also possible. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance in laboratory conditions. PACS numbers: 13.15+g, 25.30.Pt, 14.70.Fm, 25.75.Dw I. INTRODUCTION In order to explore production of massive states in neutrino-induced reactions, one should have at disposal high energy neutrino beams. On the other hand, as neutrino scattering experiments are usually performed in the laboratory reference frame, energy-momentum conservation results in high longitudinal momenta of the ﬁnal particles to be accurately evaluated for reconstructing the energy of an event. For this reason, the volume of a detector should be large enough to allow the particles to leave an interpretable signal in the bulk. Meeting or arranging these conditions is always a challenge for physicists and engineers [1]. This is particularly the case of searches for the Glashow resonance – annihilation of an electron antineutrino with an electron into an on-shell W −boson, ¯νee−→W −. The existence of this resonant process had been predicted by the theoretical physicist Sheldon Glashow in 1959 [2] but still lacks unambiguous experimental conﬁrmation [3, 4]. Meanwhile, its discovery would provide an additional important test of the Standard Model (to simplify the terminology, we write “neutrino beam”, “neutrino energy”, etc., frequently implying also antineutrino). To produce a state as heavy as W −(mW ≂80.3 GeV) in scattering with electrons at rest, the incident neutrino energy must be very high, about 6.3 × 1015 eV (6.3 PeV) [5]. The only available source of such energetic particles is cosmic rays. However, the relatively low intensity of the astrophysical neutrino beam requires signiﬁcant observation times, even at kilometerscale telescopes like IceCube [6], Baikal-GVD [7] or KM3NeT [8]. Thus, after over a decade of searches, IceCube has recorded only a few neutrino events with PeV energies [3, 9, 10]. Of these, one shower appeared in the vicinity of the resonance, having an energy of 6.05 ± 0.72 PeV [3]. The candidate events should not, of course, necessarily fall into the energy bins close to the resonance peak. Being directly related to the ﬂavor composition and the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos [11, 12], the events in principle can have energies of about 1−2 PeV [13–15]. Various implications of the detection of the Glashow resonance as well as the expected signatures have been extensively studied (e.g. in [16–23]). Nevertheless, conclusive support for this long-standing prediction is yet to be found. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow resonance that would not necessitate having initial neutrino beams? We suggest a surprisingly positive answer to this question – namely, that the process may proceed in electron–positron collisions at accelerator energies, occurring, for instance, as e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Although the resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent, quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of ρ+ from the initial state converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. Likewise, the CP conjugate channel, νee+ →W +, takes the form e+e−→W +ρ(770)−. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance. This is in contrast to the settled opinion attributing the principal obstacle to observing the resonance in laboratories to the limited energies attainable by terrestrial accelerators. The suggested reactions might occur already at total energies of order 100 GeV in the center-of-mass (cms) frame. The idea of accessing the resonance with charged lepton beams had also been addressed in [24, 25]. The article is organized as follows. In Section II we outline the mechanism of initial state radiation by focusing on a speciﬁc example of excitation of a narrow res  2 onance. In Section III we elaborate the meson analogue of the radiative return and apply it to show the presence of the resonance in reactions like e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Section IV contains a discussion of accessibility of the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance and its muon copy to experimental study. In Section V we analyze possible non-resonant channels. Section VI presents our numerical estimates of the event rates expected at future lepton collides and shortly describes the details of calculations. Finally, conclusions and some general comments are given in Section VII. II. INITIAL STATE PHOTON EMISSION To lay the groundwork for the subsequent analysis, in this section we outline a well known eﬀect in quantum electrodynamics (QED) – initial state radiation (ISR). As a speciﬁc example, let us consider electron–positron annihilation into the Z boson, e+e−→Z. This annihilation is frequently accompanied by photon emission, e+e−→Zγ, (1) which distorts the Z line shape [26]. The underlying physics becomes especially transparent in the framework of the equivalent particle approximation [27]. Even if the initial total energy of the collision is higher than the Z boson mass, s > m2 Z, the energy excess is carried away by the emitted photon, thus turning the e+e−pair to the resonance pole [28]. This gives raise to the so called radiative tail – a widening of the resonance to the right of its peak. The possibility of “tuning” the e+e−collision energy by ISR is the basis of the radiative return [29]. Using the language of the quark–parton model [30, 31], one can derive the probability density of ﬁnding a positron with energy fraction x in the parent positron [27]. In the leading order it is of the form Fe/e(x, Q2) = e2 8π2 1 + x2 1 −x ln \u0012 Q2 m2e \u0013 , (2) where e = √ 4πα is the elementary electric charge, Q2 is four-momentum transfer squared, me is the electron mass. This result is a direct consequence of the QED photon coupling to the positron current with the matrix element MQED = e [¯veγσve] ε∗ σ. (3) The corresponding diagram is shown in Fig. 1(a)."

The candidate events should not, of course, necessarily fall into the energy bins close to the resonance peak. Being directly related to the ﬂavor composition and the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos [11, 12], the events in principle can have energies of about 1−2 PeV [13–15]. Various implications of the detection of the Glashow resonance as well as the expected signatures have been extensively studied (e.g. in [16–23]). Nevertheless, conclusive support for this long-standing prediction is yet to be found. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow resonance that would not necessitate having initial neutrino beams? We suggest a surprisingly positive answer to this question – namely, that the process may proceed in electron–positron collisions at accelerator energies, occurring, for instance, as e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Although the resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent, quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of ρ+ from the initial state converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. Likewise, the CP conjugate channel, νee+ →W +, takes the form e+e−→W +ρ(770)−. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance. This is in contrast to the settled opinion attributing the principal obstacle to observing the resonance in laboratories to the limited energies attainable by terrestrial accelerators. The suggested reactions might occur already at total energies of order 100 GeV in the center-of-mass (cms) frame. The idea of accessing the resonance with charged lepton beams had also been addressed in [24, 25]. The article is organized as follows. In Section II we outline the mechanism of initial state radiation by focusing on a speciﬁc example of excitation of a narrow res  2 onance. In Section III we elaborate the meson analogue of the radiative return and apply it to show the presence of the resonance in reactions like e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Section IV contains a discussion of accessibility of the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance and its muon copy to experimental study. In Section V we analyze possible non-resonant channels. Section VI presents our numerical estimates of the event rates expected at future lepton collides and shortly describes the details of calculations. Finally, conclusions and some general comments are given in Section VII. II. INITIAL STATE PHOTON EMISSION To lay the groundwork for the subsequent analysis, in this section we outline a well known eﬀect in quantum electrodynamics (QED) – initial state radiation (ISR). As a speciﬁc example, let us consider electron–positron annihilation into the Z boson, e+e−→Z. This annihilation is frequently accompanied by photon emission, e+e−→Zγ, (1) which distorts the Z line shape [26]. The underlying physics becomes especially transparent in the framework of the equivalent particle approximation [27]. Even if the initial total energy of the collision is higher than the Z boson mass, s > m2 Z, the energy excess is carried away by the emitted photon, thus turning the e+e−pair to the resonance pole [28]. This gives raise to the so called radiative tail – a widening of the resonance to the right of its peak. The possibility of “tuning” the e+e−collision energy by ISR is the basis of the radiative return [29]. Using the language of the quark–parton model [30, 31], one can derive the probability density of ﬁnding a positron with energy fraction x in the parent positron [27]. In the leading order it is of the form Fe/e(x, Q2) = e2 8π2 1 + x2 1 −x ln \u0012 Q2 m2e \u0013 , (2) where e = √ 4πα is the elementary electric charge, Q2 is four-momentum transfer squared, me is the electron mass. This result is a direct consequence of the QED photon coupling to the positron current with the matrix element MQED = e [¯veγσve] ε∗ σ. (3) The corresponding diagram is shown in Fig. 1(a)."

INTRODUCTION In order to explore production of massive states in neutrino-induced reactions, one should have at disposal high energy neutrino beams. On the other hand, as neutrino scattering experiments are usually performed in the laboratory reference frame, energy-momentum conservation results in high longitudinal momenta of the ﬁnal particles to be accurately evaluated for reconstructing the energy of an event. For this reason, the volume of a detector should be large enough to allow the particles to leave an interpretable signal in the bulk. Meeting or arranging these conditions is always a challenge for physicists and engineers [1]. This is particularly the case of searches for the Glashow resonance – annihilation of an electron antineutrino with an electron into an on-shell W −boson, ¯νee−→W −. The existence of this resonant process had been predicted by the theoretical physicist Sheldon Glashow in 1959 [2] but still lacks unambiguous experimental conﬁrmation [3, 4]. Meanwhile, its discovery would provide an additional important test of the Standard Model (to simplify the terminology, we write “neutrino beam”, “neutrino energy”, etc., frequently implying also antineutrino). To produce a state as heavy as W −(mW ≂80.3 GeV) in scattering with electrons at rest, the incident neutrino energy must be very high, about 6.3 × 1015 eV (6.3 PeV) [5]. The only available source of such energetic particles is cosmic rays. However, the relatively low intensity of the astrophysical neutrino beam requires signiﬁcant observation times, even at kilometerscale telescopes like IceCube [6], Baikal-GVD [7] or KM3NeT [8].

INTRODUCTION In order to explore production of massive states in neutrino-induced reactions, one should have at disposal high energy neutrino beams. On the other hand, as neutrino scattering experiments are usually performed in the laboratory reference frame, energy-momentum conservation results in high longitudinal momenta of the ﬁnal particles to be accurately evaluated for reconstructing the energy of an event. For this reason, the volume of a detector should be large enough to allow the particles to leave an interpretable signal in the bulk. Meeting or arranging these conditions is always a challenge for physicists and engineers [1]. This is particularly the case of searches for the Glashow resonance – annihilation of an electron antineutrino with an electron into an on-shell W −boson, ¯νee−→W −. The existence of this resonant process had been predicted by the theoretical physicist Sheldon Glashow in 1959 [2] but still lacks unambiguous experimental conﬁrmation [3, 4]. Meanwhile, its discovery would provide an additional important test of the Standard Model (to simplify the terminology, we write “neutrino beam”, “neutrino energy”, etc., frequently implying also antineutrino). To produce a state as heavy as W −(mW ≂80.3 GeV) in scattering with electrons at rest, the incident neutrino energy must be very high, about 6.3 × 1015 eV (6.3 PeV) [5]. The only available source of such energetic particles is cosmic rays. However, the relatively low intensity of the astrophysical neutrino beam requires signiﬁcant observation times, even at kilometerscale telescopes like IceCube [6], Baikal-GVD [7] or KM3NeT [8]. Thus, after over a decade of searches, IceCube has recorded only a few neutrino events with PeV energies [3, 9, 10]. Of these, one shower appeared in the vicinity of the resonance, having an energy of 6.05 ± 0.72 PeV [3]. The candidate events should not, of course, necessarily fall into the energy bins close to the resonance peak. Being directly related to the ﬂavor composition and the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos [11, 12], the events in principle can have energies of about 1−2 PeV [13–15]. Various implications of the detection of the Glashow resonance as well as the expected signatures have been extensively studied (e.g. in [16–23]). Nevertheless, conclusive support for this long-standing prediction is yet to be found. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow resonance that would not necessitate having initial neutrino beams? We suggest a surprisingly positive answer to this question – namely, that the process may proceed in electron–positron collisions at accelerator energies, occurring, for instance, as e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Although the resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent, quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of ρ+ from the initial state converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. Likewise, the CP conjugate channel, νee+ →W +, takes the form e+e−→W +ρ(770)−. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance. This is in contrast to the settled opinion attributing the principal obstacle to observing the resonance in laboratories to the limited energies attainable by terrestrial accelerators. The suggested reactions might occur already at total energies of order 100 GeV in the center-of-mass (cms) frame. The idea of accessing the resonance with charged lepton beams had also been addressed in [24, 25]. The article is organized as follows. In Section II we outline the mechanism of initial state radiation by focusing on a speciﬁc example of excitation of a narrow res  2 onance. In Section III we elaborate the meson analogue of the radiative return and apply it to show the presence of the resonance in reactions like e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Section IV contains a discussion of accessibility of the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance and its muon copy to experimental study. In Section V we analyze possible non-resonant channels. Section VI presents our numerical estimates of the event rates expected at future lepton collides and shortly describes the details of calculations. Finally, conclusions and some general comments are given in Section VII. II. INITIAL STATE PHOTON EMISSION To lay the groundwork for the subsequent analysis, in this section we outline a well known eﬀect in quantum electrodynamics (QED) – initial state radiation (ISR). As a speciﬁc example, let us consider electron–positron annihilation into the Z boson, e+e−→Z. This annihilation is frequently accompanied by photon emission, e+e−→Zγ, (1) which distorts the Z line shape [26]. The underlying physics becomes especially transparent in the framework of the equivalent particle approximation [27]. Even if the initial total energy of the collision is higher than the Z boson mass, s > m2 Z, the energy excess is carried away by the emitted photon, thus turning the e+e−pair to the resonance pole [28]. This gives raise to the so called radiative tail – a widening of the resonance to the right of its peak. The possibility of “tuning” the e+e−collision energy by ISR is the basis of the radiative return [29].

To produce a state as heavy as W −(mW ≂80.3 GeV) in scattering with electrons at rest, the incident neutrino energy must be very high, about 6.3 × 1015 eV (6.3 PeV) [5]. The only available source of such energetic particles is cosmic rays. However, the relatively low intensity of the astrophysical neutrino beam requires signiﬁcant observation times, even at kilometerscale telescopes like IceCube [6], Baikal-GVD [7] or KM3NeT [8]. Thus, after over a decade of searches, IceCube has recorded only a few neutrino events with PeV energies [3, 9, 10]. Of these, one shower appeared in the vicinity of the resonance, having an energy of 6.05 ± 0.72 PeV [3]. The candidate events should not, of course, necessarily fall into the energy bins close to the resonance peak. Being directly related to the ﬂavor composition and the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos [11, 12], the events in principle can have energies of about 1−2 PeV [13–15]. Various implications of the detection of the Glashow resonance as well as the expected signatures have been extensively studied (e.g. in [16–23]). Nevertheless, conclusive support for this long-standing prediction is yet to be found. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow resonance that would not necessitate having initial neutrino beams? We suggest a surprisingly positive answer to this question – namely, that the process may proceed in electron–positron collisions at accelerator energies, occurring, for instance, as e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Although the resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent, quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of ρ+ from the initial state converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. Likewise, the CP conjugate channel, νee+ →W +, takes the form e+e−→W +ρ(770)−. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance. This is in contrast to the settled opinion attributing the principal obstacle to observing the resonance in laboratories to the limited energies attainable by terrestrial accelerators. The suggested reactions might occur already at total energies of order 100 GeV in the center-of-mass (cms) frame. The idea of accessing the resonance with charged lepton beams had also been addressed in [24, 25]. The article is organized as follows. In Section II we outline the mechanism of initial state radiation by focusing on a speciﬁc example of excitation of a narrow res  2 onance. In Section III we elaborate the meson analogue of the radiative return and apply it to show the presence of the resonance in reactions like e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Section IV contains a discussion of accessibility of the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance and its muon copy to experimental study. In Section V we analyze possible non-resonant channels. Section VI presents our numerical estimates of the event rates expected at future lepton collides and shortly describes the details of calculations. Finally, conclusions and some general comments are given in Section VII. II. INITIAL STATE PHOTON EMISSION To lay the groundwork for the subsequent analysis, in this section we outline a well known eﬀect in quantum electrodynamics (QED) – initial state radiation (ISR). As a speciﬁc example, let us consider electron–positron annihilation into the Z boson, e+e−→Z. This annihilation is frequently accompanied by photon emission, e+e−→Zγ, (1) which distorts the Z line shape [26]. The underlying physics becomes especially transparent in the framework of the equivalent particle approximation [27]. Even if the initial total energy of the collision is higher than the Z boson mass, s > m2 Z, the energy excess is carried away by the emitted photon, thus turning the e+e−pair to the resonance pole [28]. This gives raise to the so called radiative tail – a widening of the resonance to the right of its peak. The possibility of “tuning” the e+e−collision energy by ISR is the basis of the radiative return [29]. Using the language of the quark–parton model [30, 31], one can derive the probability density of ﬁnding a positron with energy fraction x in the parent positron [27]. In the leading order it is of the form Fe/e(x, Q2) = e2 8π2 1 + x2 1 −x ln \u0012 Q2 m2e \u0013 , (2) where e = √ 4πα is the elementary electric charge, Q2 is four-momentum transfer squared, me is the electron mass. This result is a direct consequence of the QED photon coupling to the positron current with the matrix element MQED = e [¯veγσve] ε∗ σ. (3) The corresponding diagram is shown in Fig. 1(a)."

As a speciﬁc example, let us consider electron–positron annihilation into the Z boson, e+e−→Z. This annihilation is frequently accompanied by photon emission, e+e−→Zγ, (1) which distorts the Z line shape [26]. The underlying physics becomes especially transparent in the framework of the equivalent particle approximation [27]. Even if the initial total energy of the collision is higher than the Z boson mass, s > m2 Z, the energy excess is carried away by the emitted photon, thus turning the e+e−pair to the resonance pole [28]. This gives raise to the so called radiative tail – a widening of the resonance to the right of its peak. The possibility of “tuning” the e+e−collision energy by ISR is the basis of the radiative return [29]. Using the language of the quark–parton model [30, 31], one can derive the probability density of ﬁnding a positron with energy fraction x in the parent positron [27]. In the leading order it is of the form Fe/e(x, Q2) = e2 8π2 1 + x2 1 −x ln \u0012 Q2 m2e \u0013 , (2) where e = √ 4πα is the elementary electric charge, Q2 is four-momentum transfer squared, me is the electron mass. This result is a direct consequence of the QED photon coupling to the positron current with the matrix element MQED = e [¯veγσve] ε∗ σ. (3) The corresponding diagram is shown in Fig. 1(a)."

INTRODUCTION In order to explore production of massive states in neutrino-induced reactions, one should have at disposal high energy neutrino beams. On the other hand, as neutrino scattering experiments are usually performed in the laboratory reference frame, energy-momentum conservation results in high longitudinal momenta of the ﬁnal particles to be accurately evaluated for reconstructing the energy of an event. For this reason, the volume of a detector should be large enough to allow the particles to leave an interpretable signal in the bulk. Meeting or arranging these conditions is always a challenge for physicists and engineers [1]. This is particularly the case of searches for the Glashow resonance – annihilation of an electron antineutrino with an electron into an on-shell W −boson, ¯νee−→W −. The existence of this resonant process had been predicted by the theoretical physicist Sheldon Glashow in 1959 [2] but still lacks unambiguous experimental conﬁrmation [3, 4]. Meanwhile, its discovery would provide an additional important test of the Standard Model (to simplify the terminology, we write “neutrino beam”, “neutrino energy”, etc., frequently implying also antineutrino). To produce a state as heavy as W −(mW ≂80.3 GeV) in scattering with electrons at rest, the incident neutrino energy must be very high, about 6.3 × 1015 eV (6.3 PeV) [5]. The only available source of such energetic particles is cosmic rays. However, the relatively low intensity of the astrophysical neutrino beam requires signiﬁcant observation times, even at kilometerscale telescopes like IceCube [6], Baikal-GVD [7] or KM3NeT [8]. Thus, after over a decade of searches, IceCube has recorded only a few neutrino events with PeV energies [3, 9, 10]. Of these, one shower appeared in the vicinity of the resonance, having an energy of 6.05 ± 0.72 PeV [3]. The candidate events should not, of course, necessarily fall into the energy bins close to the resonance peak. Being directly related to the ﬂavor composition and the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos [11, 12], the events in principle can have energies of about 1−2 PeV [13–15]. Various implications of the detection of the Glashow resonance as well as the expected signatures have been extensively studied (e.g. in [16–23]). Nevertheless, conclusive support for this long-standing prediction is yet to be found. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow resonance that would not necessitate having initial neutrino beams? We suggest a surprisingly positive answer to this question – namely, that the process may proceed in electron–positron collisions at accelerator energies, occurring, for instance, as e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Although the resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent, quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of ρ+ from the initial state converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. Likewise, the CP conjugate channel, νee+ →W +, takes the form e+e−→W +ρ(770)−. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance. This is in contrast to the settled opinion attributing the principal obstacle to observing the resonance in laboratories to the limited energies attainable by terrestrial accelerators. The suggested reactions might occur already at total energies of order 100 GeV in the center-of-mass (cms) frame. The idea of accessing the resonance with charged lepton beams had also been addressed in [24, 25]. The article is organized as follows. In Section II we outline the mechanism of initial state radiation by focusing on a speciﬁc example of excitation of a narrow res  2 onance. In Section III we elaborate the meson analogue of the radiative return and apply it to show the presence of the resonance in reactions like e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Section IV contains a discussion of accessibility of the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance and its muon copy to experimental study. In Section V we analyze possible non-resonant channels. Section VI presents our numerical estimates of the event rates expected at future lepton collides and shortly describes the details of calculations.

On the other hand, as neutrino scattering experiments are usually performed in the laboratory reference frame, energy-momentum conservation results in high longitudinal momenta of the ﬁnal particles to be accurately evaluated for reconstructing the energy of an event. For this reason, the volume of a detector should be large enough to allow the particles to leave an interpretable signal in the bulk. Meeting or arranging these conditions is always a challenge for physicists and engineers [1]. This is particularly the case of searches for the Glashow resonance – annihilation of an electron antineutrino with an electron into an on-shell W −boson, ¯νee−→W −. The existence of this resonant process had been predicted by the theoretical physicist Sheldon Glashow in 1959 [2] but still lacks unambiguous experimental conﬁrmation [3, 4]. Meanwhile, its discovery would provide an additional important test of the Standard Model (to simplify the terminology, we write “neutrino beam”, “neutrino energy”, etc., frequently implying also antineutrino). To produce a state as heavy as W −(mW ≂80.3 GeV) in scattering with electrons at rest, the incident neutrino energy must be very high, about 6.3 × 1015 eV (6.3 PeV) [5]. The only available source of such energetic particles is cosmic rays. However, the relatively low intensity of the astrophysical neutrino beam requires signiﬁcant observation times, even at kilometerscale telescopes like IceCube [6], Baikal-GVD [7] or KM3NeT [8]. Thus, after over a decade of searches, IceCube has recorded only a few neutrino events with PeV energies [3, 9, 10]. Of these, one shower appeared in the vicinity of the resonance, having an energy of 6.05 ± 0.72 PeV [3]. The candidate events should not, of course, necessarily fall into the energy bins close to the resonance peak. Being directly related to the ﬂavor composition and the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos [11, 12], the events in principle can have energies of about 1−2 PeV [13–15]. Various implications of the detection of the Glashow resonance as well as the expected signatures have been extensively studied (e.g. in [16–23]). Nevertheless, conclusive support for this long-standing prediction is yet to be found. One might therefore ask: are there reactions with the Glashow resonance that would not necessitate having initial neutrino beams? We suggest a surprisingly positive answer to this question – namely, that the process may proceed in electron–positron collisions at accelerator energies, occurring, for instance, as e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Although the resonance appears somewhat disguised, the underlying physics is transparent, quite resembling the well known radiative return: emission of ρ+ from the initial state converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. Likewise, the CP conjugate channel, νee+ →W +, takes the form e+e−→W +ρ(770)−. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance. This is in contrast to the settled opinion attributing the principal obstacle to observing the resonance in laboratories to the limited energies attainable by terrestrial accelerators. The suggested reactions might occur already at total energies of order 100 GeV in the center-of-mass (cms) frame. The idea of accessing the resonance with charged lepton beams had also been addressed in [24, 25]. The article is organized as follows. In Section II we outline the mechanism of initial state radiation by focusing on a speciﬁc example of excitation of a narrow res  2 onance. In Section III we elaborate the meson analogue of the radiative return and apply it to show the presence of the resonance in reactions like e+e−→W −ρ(770)+. Section IV contains a discussion of accessibility of the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance and its muon copy to experimental study. In Section V we analyze possible non-resonant channels. Section VI presents our numerical estimates of the event rates expected at future lepton collides and shortly describes the details of calculations. Finally, conclusions and some general comments are given in Section VII. II. INITIAL STATE PHOTON EMISSION To lay the groundwork for the subsequent analysis, in this section we outline a well known eﬀect in quantum electrodynamics (QED) – initial state radiation (ISR). As a speciﬁc example, let us consider electron–positron annihilation into the Z boson, e+e−→Z. This annihilation is frequently accompanied by photon emission, e+e−→Zγ, (1) which distorts the Z line shape [26]. The underlying physics becomes especially transparent in the framework of the equivalent particle approximation [27]. Even if the initial total energy of the collision is higher than the Z boson mass, s > m2 Z, the energy excess is carried away by the emitted photon, thus turning the e+e−pair to the resonance pole [28]. This gives raise to the so called radiative tail – a widening of the resonance to the right of its peak. The possibility of “tuning” the e+e−collision energy by ISR is the basis of the radiative return [29]. Using the language of the quark–parton model [30, 31], one can derive the probability density of ﬁnding a positron with energy fraction x in the parent positron [27]. In the leading order it is of the form Fe/e(x, Q2) = e2 8π2 1 + x2 1 −x ln \u0012 Q2 m2e \u0013 , (2) where e = √ 4πα is the elementary electric charge, Q2 is four-momentum transfer squared, me is the electron mass. This result is a direct consequence of the QED photon coupling to the positron current with the matrix element MQED = e [¯veγσve] ε∗ σ. (3) The corresponding diagram is shown in Fig. 1(a)."

The cross section turns out to be proportional to the antineutrino distribution in the positron. Projecting out a parton distribution in a cross section is a general indicator of excitation of a narrow resonance [27]. In our case, the ratio of the total width of W −to its mass is ≂1/40 such that the assumption about the relative narrowness of the Glashow resonance is acceptable. The same situation, by the way, occurs for e+e−→Zγ. One can verify that its leading order cross section [34] is a projection of the QED electron distribution Fe/e(x, s). As may be already obvious, the discussed mechanism is realizable not only with ρ±, but also with a relatively wide set of scalar and vector particles (not necessarily onshell) provided: (i) they couple to the electroweak currents; (ii) their squared four-momenta are much smaller compared to those of the produced ﬁnal states. In general, the process will have the form: e+e−→W −h+, where h+ is any allowed state satisfying the above conditions. For example, from the kinematical point of view, a favourable reaction to excite the Glashow resonance would be e+e−→W −π+ due to the smallness of the pion mass, but its probability is helicity-suppressed. This is the reason we have chosen the ρ meson to illustrate the resonant mechanism. It is a vector particle, free from the helicity-suppression and, in addition, relatively light. On the other hand, dealing with the speciﬁc familiar charged meson, our discussion is not abstract. Another promising channel may be e+e−→W −D∗+ s , where D∗+ s is the meson of mass mD∗s = 2112.2 MeV with explicitly nonzero quantum numbers of charm and strangeness, C = S = 1 [39]. The width and decay modes of D∗± s are consistent with the spin-parity JP = 1−. Its coupling to the leptonic weak current is favoured by the CKM element |Vcs|. IV. CP SYMMETRY AND LEPTON UNIVERSALITY Usually, neither the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance, νee+ → W +, nor its copy for muons, ¯νµµ−→ W −, is discussed in the literature. Meanwhile, these channels are also signiﬁcant predictions of   4 the Standard Model still requiring experimental veriﬁcation. The latter would furnish important support for CP symmetry and lepton universality in the neutrino sector of the Standard Model. At ﬁrst glance, the channels seem to be inaccessible to experimental study because the problem is complicated by the need to arrange collisions of neutrinos with positrons or muons. A way out of this diﬃculty might be invoking the method of equivalent particles. For example, it has been known that with each electrically charged particle one can associate distributions of charged leptons, e±, µ± and, in some cases, even τ ± [27]. To put another way, with certain probability depending on kinematical conditions a charged particle is able to manifest itself as a positron, a muon or a tau lepton. The distributions are the QED analogues of those for the quarks and gluons such that accurately computable by well-developed methods. One thus could exploit atomic nuclei as sources of positrons and muons to get access to the channels like ν (–) le+ →X and ν (–) lµ± →X′ producing massive ﬁnal states X [40, 41]. This is closely related to the ability of photons to split into l+l−pairs [27, 42, 43] in interactions with neutrinos [44, 45]. On the other hand, as was discussed in the previous section, one can introduce a neutrino distribution in the electron. By lepton universality, the same result holds for muons as well. This makes it in principle possible to test both the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance and its copy for the second generation of leptons via the reactions e+e−→W +ρ−, µ+µ−→W ∓ρ± for which the diagrams are shown in Fig. 2. In the Standard Model, their cross sections coincide at high energies, being given by (9). V. NONRESONANT BACKGROUND By nonresonant background we mean those channels in e+e−(µ+µ−) scattering that produce exactly the same ﬁnal states as above, W ∓ρ±, without, however, exciting the Glashow resonance. The possible leading order background can in general be represented by two s-channel Feynman diagrams with γ and Z exchanges as shown in Fig. 3. For completeness, one could also add a similar graph with an intermediate Higgs boson, but we ignore it. In principle, the vertices γWρ and ZWρ may arise in eﬀective theories like vector meson dominance extended to weak interactions [46]. Anyway, these diagrams would yield terms in a cross section behaving like ∼m2 W /s2 as s grows, and without the logarithmic enhancement. As a result, the related contribution will decrease much faster with energy than 1/s ln(s/m2 ρ) following from (9). Another independent reason of suppression of the background is due to the couplings γWρ and ZWρ. The latter are constrained by the non-observation of the decay modes W ± →γρ± and Z →W ±ρ∓. Note that at the Z pole the contribution of the diagram in Fig. 3(b) suﬀers a phase-space suppresFIG. 2. Diagrams illustrating: (a) excitation of the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance accompanied by initial state ρ−meson emission, e+e−→W +ρ−; (b) excitation of the muon copy of the Glashow resonance accompanied by initial state ρ+ meson emission, µ+µ−→W −ρ+.

The arrows sketch the spatial momentum ﬂows. sion due to the mass diﬀerence mZ −mW ∼10 GeV. Thus, these background channels seem to play a minor role (if any). VI. NUMERICAL RESULTS There have been various proposal for future highluminosity lepton colliders [47]. Among others, their goal is to explore physics at the Z (√s = 91 GeV) and Higgs boson (√s = 125 GeV) poles. These energies are also enough for the considered resonant reactions to proceed, for instance, as e+e−→W ∓ρ± and e+e−→W ∓D∗± s . Table I summarizes our estimates of the associated number of events that could occur at collider experiments assuming integrated luminosity of 10 ab−1. The cross sections are calculated by formula (9), with the obvious replacements |Vud| →|Vcs|, fρ →fD∗ s , mρ →mD∗ s in case of D∗± s . The values of GF , |Vud|, |Vcs| as well as the masses of ρ±, D∗± s and mW are taken from the Particle Data Group [39]. To be sure that the adopted approximation is justiﬁed we leave out of consideration the W ∓D∗± s channel at √s = 91 GeV. The results show that the rate of excitation of the Glashow resonance at future colliders might be higher than that at the currently conducted experiments exploiting natural neutrino beams.

The cross section turns out to be proportional to the antineutrino distribution in the positron. Projecting out a parton distribution in a cross section is a general indicator of excitation of a narrow resonance [27]. In our case, the ratio of the total width of W −to its mass is ≂1/40 such that the assumption about the relative narrowness of the Glashow resonance is acceptable. The same situation, by the way, occurs for e+e−→Zγ. One can verify that its leading order cross section [34] is a projection of the QED electron distribution Fe/e(x, s). As may be already obvious, the discussed mechanism is realizable not only with ρ±, but also with a relatively wide set of scalar and vector particles (not necessarily onshell) provided: (i) they couple to the electroweak currents; (ii) their squared four-momenta are much smaller compared to those of the produced ﬁnal states. In general, the process will have the form: e+e−→W −h+, where h+ is any allowed state satisfying the above conditions. For example, from the kinematical point of view, a favourable reaction to excite the Glashow resonance would be e+e−→W −π+ due to the smallness of the pion mass, but its probability is helicity-suppressed. This is the reason we have chosen the ρ meson to illustrate the resonant mechanism. It is a vector particle, free from the helicity-suppression and, in addition, relatively light. On the other hand, dealing with the speciﬁc familiar charged meson, our discussion is not abstract. Another promising channel may be e+e−→W −D∗+ s , where D∗+ s is the meson of mass mD∗s = 2112.2 MeV with explicitly nonzero quantum numbers of charm and strangeness, C = S = 1 [39]. The width and decay modes of D∗± s are consistent with the spin-parity JP = 1−. Its coupling to the leptonic weak current is favoured by the CKM element |Vcs|. IV. CP SYMMETRY AND LEPTON UNIVERSALITY Usually, neither the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance, νee+ → W +, nor its copy for muons, ¯νµµ−→ W −, is discussed in the literature. Meanwhile, these channels are also signiﬁcant predictions of   4 the Standard Model still requiring experimental veriﬁcation. The latter would furnish important support for CP symmetry and lepton universality in the neutrino sector of the Standard Model. At ﬁrst glance, the channels seem to be inaccessible to experimental study because the problem is complicated by the need to arrange collisions of neutrinos with positrons or muons. A way out of this diﬃculty might be invoking the method of equivalent particles. For example, it has been known that with each electrically charged particle one can associate distributions of charged leptons, e±, µ± and, in some cases, even τ ± [27]. To put another way, with certain probability depending on kinematical conditions a charged particle is able to manifest itself as a positron, a muon or a tau lepton. The distributions are the QED analogues of those for the quarks and gluons such that accurately computable by well-developed methods. One thus could exploit atomic nuclei as sources of positrons and muons to get access to the channels like ν (–) le+ →X and ν (–) lµ± →X′ producing massive ﬁnal states X [40, 41]. This is closely related to the ability of photons to split into l+l−pairs [27, 42, 43] in interactions with neutrinos [44, 45]. On the other hand, as was discussed in the previous section, one can introduce a neutrino distribution in the electron. By lepton universality, the same result holds for muons as well. This makes it in principle possible to test both the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance and its copy for the second generation of leptons via the reactions e+e−→W +ρ−, µ+µ−→W ∓ρ± for which the diagrams are shown in Fig. 2. In the Standard Model, their cross sections coincide at high energies, being given by (9). V. NONRESONANT BACKGROUND By nonresonant background we mean those channels in e+e−(µ+µ−) scattering that produce exactly the same ﬁnal states as above, W ∓ρ±, without, however, exciting the Glashow resonance. The possible leading order background can in general be represented by two s-channel Feynman diagrams with γ and Z exchanges as shown in Fig. 3. For completeness, one could also add a similar graph with an intermediate Higgs boson, but we ignore it. In principle, the vertices γWρ and ZWρ may arise in eﬀective theories like vector meson dominance extended to weak interactions [46]. Anyway, these diagrams would yield terms in a cross section behaving like ∼m2 W /s2 as s grows, and without the logarithmic enhancement. As a result, the related contribution will decrease much faster with energy than 1/s ln(s/m2 ρ) following from (9). Another independent reason of suppression of the background is due to the couplings γWρ and ZWρ. The latter are constrained by the non-observation of the decay modes W ± →γρ± and Z →W ±ρ∓. Note that at the Z pole the contribution of the diagram in Fig. 3(b) suﬀers a phase-space suppresFIG. 2. Diagrams illustrating: (a) excitation of the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance accompanied by initial state ρ−meson emission, e+e−→W +ρ−; (b) excitation of the muon copy of the Glashow resonance accompanied by initial state ρ+ meson emission, µ+µ−→W −ρ+.

NUMERICAL RESULTS There have been various proposal for future highluminosity lepton colliders [47]. Among others, their goal is to explore physics at the Z (√s = 91 GeV) and Higgs boson (√s = 125 GeV) poles. These energies are also enough for the considered resonant reactions to proceed, for instance, as e+e−→W ∓ρ± and e+e−→W ∓D∗± s . Table I summarizes our estimates of the associated number of events that could occur at collider experiments assuming integrated luminosity of 10 ab−1. The cross sections are calculated by formula (9), with the obvious replacements |Vud| →|Vcs|, fρ →fD∗ s , mρ →mD∗ s in case of D∗± s . The values of GF , |Vud|, |Vcs| as well as the masses of ρ±, D∗± s and mW are taken from the Particle Data Group [39]. To be sure that the adopted approximation is justiﬁed we leave out of consideration the W ∓D∗± s channel at √s = 91 GeV. The results show that the rate of excitation of the Glashow resonance at future colliders might be higher than that at the currently conducted experiments exploiting natural neutrino beams.

As may be already obvious, the discussed mechanism is realizable not only with ρ±, but also with a relatively wide set of scalar and vector particles (not necessarily onshell) provided: (i) they couple to the electroweak currents; (ii) their squared four-momenta are much smaller compared to those of the produced ﬁnal states. In general, the process will have the form: e+e−→W −h+, where h+ is any allowed state satisfying the above conditions. For example, from the kinematical point of view, a favourable reaction to excite the Glashow resonance would be e+e−→W −π+ due to the smallness of the pion mass, but its probability is helicity-suppressed. This is the reason we have chosen the ρ meson to illustrate the resonant mechanism. It is a vector particle, free from the helicity-suppression and, in addition, relatively light. On the other hand, dealing with the speciﬁc familiar charged meson, our discussion is not abstract. Another promising channel may be e+e−→W −D∗+ s , where D∗+ s is the meson of mass mD∗s = 2112.2 MeV with explicitly nonzero quantum numbers of charm and strangeness, C = S = 1 [39]. The width and decay modes of D∗± s are consistent with the spin-parity JP = 1−. Its coupling to the leptonic weak current is favoured by the CKM element |Vcs|. IV. CP SYMMETRY AND LEPTON UNIVERSALITY Usually, neither the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance, νee+ → W +, nor its copy for muons, ¯νµµ−→ W −, is discussed in the literature. Meanwhile, these channels are also signiﬁcant predictions of   4 the Standard Model still requiring experimental veriﬁcation. The latter would furnish important support for CP symmetry and lepton universality in the neutrino sector of the Standard Model. At ﬁrst glance, the channels seem to be inaccessible to experimental study because the problem is complicated by the need to arrange collisions of neutrinos with positrons or muons. A way out of this diﬃculty might be invoking the method of equivalent particles. For example, it has been known that with each electrically charged particle one can associate distributions of charged leptons, e±, µ± and, in some cases, even τ ± [27]. To put another way, with certain probability depending on kinematical conditions a charged particle is able to manifest itself as a positron, a muon or a tau lepton. The distributions are the QED analogues of those for the quarks and gluons such that accurately computable by well-developed methods. One thus could exploit atomic nuclei as sources of positrons and muons to get access to the channels like ν (–) le+ →X and ν (–) lµ± →X′ producing massive ﬁnal states X [40, 41]. This is closely related to the ability of photons to split into l+l−pairs [27, 42, 43] in interactions with neutrinos [44, 45]. On the other hand, as was discussed in the previous section, one can introduce a neutrino distribution in the electron. By lepton universality, the same result holds for muons as well. This makes it in principle possible to test both the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance and its copy for the second generation of leptons via the reactions e+e−→W +ρ−, µ+µ−→W ∓ρ± for which the diagrams are shown in Fig. 2. In the Standard Model, their cross sections coincide at high energies, being given by (9). V. NONRESONANT BACKGROUND By nonresonant background we mean those channels in e+e−(µ+µ−) scattering that produce exactly the same ﬁnal states as above, W ∓ρ±, without, however, exciting the Glashow resonance. The possible leading order background can in general be represented by two s-channel Feynman diagrams with γ and Z exchanges as shown in Fig. 3. For completeness, one could also add a similar graph with an intermediate Higgs boson, but we ignore it. In principle, the vertices γWρ and ZWρ may arise in eﬀective theories like vector meson dominance extended to weak interactions [46]. Anyway, these diagrams would yield terms in a cross section behaving like ∼m2 W /s2 as s grows, and without the logarithmic enhancement. As a result, the related contribution will decrease much faster with energy than 1/s ln(s/m2 ρ) following from (9). Another independent reason of suppression of the background is due to the couplings γWρ and ZWρ. The latter are constrained by the non-observation of the decay modes W ± →γρ± and Z →W ±ρ∓. Note that at the Z pole the contribution of the diagram in Fig. 3(b) suﬀers a phase-space suppresFIG. 2.

NUMERICAL RESULTS There have been various proposal for future highluminosity lepton colliders [47]. Among others, their goal is to explore physics at the Z (√s = 91 GeV) and Higgs boson (√s = 125 GeV) poles. These energies are also enough for the considered resonant reactions to proceed, for instance, as e+e−→W ∓ρ± and e+e−→W ∓D∗± s . Table I summarizes our estimates of the associated number of events that could occur at collider experiments assuming integrated luminosity of 10 ab−1. The cross sections are calculated by formula (9), with the obvious replacements |Vud| →|Vcs|, fρ →fD∗ s , mρ →mD∗ s in case of D∗± s . The values of GF , |Vud|, |Vcs| as well as the masses of ρ±, D∗± s and mW are taken from the Particle Data Group [39]. To be sure that the adopted approximation is justiﬁed we leave out of consideration the W ∓D∗± s channel at √s = 91 GeV. The results show that the rate of excitation of the Glashow resonance at future colliders might be higher than that at the currently conducted experiments exploiting natural neutrino beams.

The width and decay modes of D∗± s are consistent with the spin-parity JP = 1−. Its coupling to the leptonic weak current is favoured by the CKM element |Vcs|. IV. CP SYMMETRY AND LEPTON UNIVERSALITY Usually, neither the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance, νee+ → W +, nor its copy for muons, ¯νµµ−→ W −, is discussed in the literature. Meanwhile, these channels are also signiﬁcant predictions of   4 the Standard Model still requiring experimental veriﬁcation. The latter would furnish important support for CP symmetry and lepton universality in the neutrino sector of the Standard Model. At ﬁrst glance, the channels seem to be inaccessible to experimental study because the problem is complicated by the need to arrange collisions of neutrinos with positrons or muons. A way out of this diﬃculty might be invoking the method of equivalent particles. For example, it has been known that with each electrically charged particle one can associate distributions of charged leptons, e±, µ± and, in some cases, even τ ± [27]. To put another way, with certain probability depending on kinematical conditions a charged particle is able to manifest itself as a positron, a muon or a tau lepton. The distributions are the QED analogues of those for the quarks and gluons such that accurately computable by well-developed methods. One thus could exploit atomic nuclei as sources of positrons and muons to get access to the channels like ν (–) le+ →X and ν (–) lµ± →X′ producing massive ﬁnal states X [40, 41]. This is closely related to the ability of photons to split into l+l−pairs [27, 42, 43] in interactions with neutrinos [44, 45]. On the other hand, as was discussed in the previous section, one can introduce a neutrino distribution in the electron. By lepton universality, the same result holds for muons as well. This makes it in principle possible to test both the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance and its copy for the second generation of leptons via the reactions e+e−→W +ρ−, µ+µ−→W ∓ρ± for which the diagrams are shown in Fig. 2. In the Standard Model, their cross sections coincide at high energies, being given by (9). V. NONRESONANT BACKGROUND By nonresonant background we mean those channels in e+e−(µ+µ−) scattering that produce exactly the same ﬁnal states as above, W ∓ρ±, without, however, exciting the Glashow resonance. The possible leading order background can in general be represented by two s-channel Feynman diagrams with γ and Z exchanges as shown in Fig. 3. For completeness, one could also add a similar graph with an intermediate Higgs boson, but we ignore it. In principle, the vertices γWρ and ZWρ may arise in eﬀective theories like vector meson dominance extended to weak interactions [46]. Anyway, these diagrams would yield terms in a cross section behaving like ∼m2 W /s2 as s grows, and without the logarithmic enhancement. As a result, the related contribution will decrease much faster with energy than 1/s ln(s/m2 ρ) following from (9). Another independent reason of suppression of the background is due to the couplings γWρ and ZWρ. The latter are constrained by the non-observation of the decay modes W ± →γρ± and Z →W ±ρ∓. Note that at the Z pole the contribution of the diagram in Fig. 3(b) suﬀers a phase-space suppresFIG. 2.

NUMERICAL RESULTS There have been various proposal for future highluminosity lepton colliders [47]. Among others, their goal is to explore physics at the Z (√s = 91 GeV) and Higgs boson (√s = 125 GeV) poles. These energies are also enough for the considered resonant reactions to proceed, for instance, as e+e−→W ∓ρ± and e+e−→W ∓D∗± s . Table I summarizes our estimates of the associated number of events that could occur at collider experiments assuming integrated luminosity of 10 ab−1.

The values of GF , |Vud|, |Vcs| as well as the masses of ρ±, D∗± s and mW are taken from the Particle Data Group [39]. To be sure that the adopted approximation is justiﬁed we leave out of consideration the W ∓D∗± s channel at √s = 91 GeV.

One thus could exploit atomic nuclei as sources of positrons and muons to get access to the channels like ν (–) le+ →X and ν (–) lµ± →X′ producing massive ﬁnal states X [40, 41]. This is closely related to the ability of photons to split into l+l−pairs [27, 42, 43] in interactions with neutrinos [44, 45]. On the other hand, as was discussed in the previous section, one can introduce a neutrino distribution in the electron. By lepton universality, the same result holds for muons as well.

NONRESONANT BACKGROUND By nonresonant background we mean those channels in e+e−(µ+µ−) scattering that produce exactly the same ﬁnal states as above, W ∓ρ±, without, however, exciting the Glashow resonance. The possible leading order background can in general be represented by two s-channel Feynman diagrams with γ and Z exchanges as shown in Fig. 3. For completeness, one could also add a similar graph with an intermediate Higgs boson, but we ignore it. In principle, the vertices γWρ and ZWρ may arise in eﬀective theories like vector meson dominance extended to weak interactions [46]. Anyway, these diagrams would yield terms in a cross section behaving like ∼m2 W /s2 as s grows, and without the logarithmic enhancement. As a result, the related contribution will decrease much faster with energy than 1/s ln(s/m2 ρ) following from (9). Another independent reason of suppression of the background is due to the couplings γWρ and ZWρ. The latter are constrained by the non-observation of the decay modes W ± →γρ± and Z →W ±ρ∓.

NUMERICAL RESULTS There have been various proposal for future highluminosity lepton colliders [47]. Among others, their goal is to explore physics at the Z (√s = 91 GeV) and Higgs boson (√s = 125 GeV) poles. These energies are also enough for the considered resonant reactions to proceed, for instance, as e+e−→W ∓ρ± and e+e−→W ∓D∗± s .

The cross section turns out to be proportional to the antineutrino distribution in the positron. Projecting out a parton distribution in a cross section is a general indicator of excitation of a narrow resonance [27]. In our case, the ratio of the total width of W −to its mass is ≂1/40 such that the assumption about the relative narrowness of the Glashow resonance is acceptable. The same situation, by the way, occurs for e+e−→Zγ. One can verify that its leading order cross section [34] is a projection of the QED electron distribution Fe/e(x, s). As may be already obvious, the discussed mechanism is realizable not only with ρ±, but also with a relatively wide set of scalar and vector particles (not necessarily onshell) provided: (i) they couple to the electroweak currents; (ii) their squared four-momenta are much smaller compared to those of the produced ﬁnal states. In general, the process will have the form: e+e−→W −h+, where h+ is any allowed state satisfying the above conditions. For example, from the kinematical point of view, a favourable reaction to excite the Glashow resonance would be e+e−→W −π+ due to the smallness of the pion mass, but its probability is helicity-suppressed. This is the reason we have chosen the ρ meson to illustrate the resonant mechanism. It is a vector particle, free from the helicity-suppression and, in addition, relatively light. On the other hand, dealing with the speciﬁc familiar charged meson, our discussion is not abstract. Another promising channel may be e+e−→W −D∗+ s , where D∗+ s is the meson of mass mD∗s = 2112.2 MeV with explicitly nonzero quantum numbers of charm and strangeness, C = S = 1 [39]. The width and decay modes of D∗± s are consistent with the spin-parity JP = 1−. Its coupling to the leptonic weak current is favoured by the CKM element |Vcs|. IV. CP SYMMETRY AND LEPTON UNIVERSALITY Usually, neither the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance, νee+ → W +, nor its copy for muons, ¯νµµ−→ W −, is discussed in the literature. Meanwhile, these channels are also signiﬁcant predictions of   4 the Standard Model still requiring experimental veriﬁcation. The latter would furnish important support for CP symmetry and lepton universality in the neutrino sector of the Standard Model. At ﬁrst glance, the channels seem to be inaccessible to experimental study because the problem is complicated by the need to arrange collisions of neutrinos with positrons or muons. A way out of this diﬃculty might be invoking the method of equivalent particles. For example, it has been known that with each electrically charged particle one can associate distributions of charged leptons, e±, µ± and, in some cases, even τ ± [27].

Anyway, these diagrams would yield terms in a cross section behaving like ∼m2 W /s2 as s grows, and without the logarithmic enhancement. As a result, the related contribution will decrease much faster with energy than 1/s ln(s/m2 ρ) following from (9). Another independent reason of suppression of the background is due to the couplings γWρ and ZWρ. The latter are constrained by the non-observation of the decay modes W ± →γρ± and Z →W ±ρ∓.

NUMERICAL RESULTS There have been various proposal for future highluminosity lepton colliders [47]. Among others, their goal is to explore physics at the Z (√s = 91 GeV) and Higgs boson (√s = 125 GeV) poles. These energies are also enough for the considered resonant reactions to proceed, for instance, as e+e−→W ∓ρ± and e+e−→W ∓D∗± s .

The cross section turns out to be proportional to the antineutrino distribution in the positron. Projecting out a parton distribution in a cross section is a general indicator of excitation of a narrow resonance [27]. In our case, the ratio of the total width of W −to its mass is ≂1/40 such that the assumption about the relative narrowness of the Glashow resonance is acceptable. The same situation, by the way, occurs for e+e−→Zγ. One can verify that its leading order cross section [34] is a projection of the QED electron distribution Fe/e(x, s). As may be already obvious, the discussed mechanism is realizable not only with ρ±, but also with a relatively wide set of scalar and vector particles (not necessarily onshell) provided: (i) they couple to the electroweak currents; (ii) their squared four-momenta are much smaller compared to those of the produced ﬁnal states. In general, the process will have the form: e+e−→W −h+, where h+ is any allowed state satisfying the above conditions. For example, from the kinematical point of view, a favourable reaction to excite the Glashow resonance would be e+e−→W −π+ due to the smallness of the pion mass, but its probability is helicity-suppressed. This is the reason we have chosen the ρ meson to illustrate the resonant mechanism. It is a vector particle, free from the helicity-suppression and, in addition, relatively light. On the other hand, dealing with the speciﬁc familiar charged meson, our discussion is not abstract. Another promising channel may be e+e−→W −D∗+ s , where D∗+ s is the meson of mass mD∗s = 2112.2 MeV with explicitly nonzero quantum numbers of charm and strangeness, C = S = 1 [39]. The width and decay modes of D∗± s are consistent with the spin-parity JP = 1−. Its coupling to the leptonic weak current is favoured by the CKM element |Vcs|. IV. CP SYMMETRY AND LEPTON UNIVERSALITY Usually, neither the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance, νee+ → W +, nor its copy for muons, ¯νµµ−→ W −, is discussed in the literature. Meanwhile, these channels are also signiﬁcant predictions of   4 the Standard Model still requiring experimental veriﬁcation. The latter would furnish important support for CP symmetry and lepton universality in the neutrino sector of the Standard Model. At ﬁrst glance, the channels seem to be inaccessible to experimental study because the problem is complicated by the need to arrange collisions of neutrinos with positrons or muons. A way out of this diﬃculty might be invoking the method of equivalent particles. For example, it has been known that with each electrically charged particle one can associate distributions of charged leptons, e±, µ± and, in some cases, even τ ± [27]. To put another way, with certain probability depending on kinematical conditions a charged particle is able to manifest itself as a positron, a muon or a tau lepton. The distributions are the QED analogues of those for the quarks and gluons such that accurately computable by well-developed methods. One thus could exploit atomic nuclei as sources of positrons and muons to get access to the channels like ν (–) le+ →X and ν (–) lµ± →X′ producing massive ﬁnal states X [40, 41]. This is closely related to the ability of photons to split into l+l−pairs [27, 42, 43] in interactions with neutrinos [44, 45]. On the other hand, as was discussed in the previous section, one can introduce a neutrino distribution in the electron. By lepton universality, the same result holds for muons as well. This makes it in principle possible to test both the CP conjugate of the Glashow resonance and its copy for the second generation of leptons via the reactions e+e−→W +ρ−, µ+µ−→W ∓ρ± for which the diagrams are shown in Fig. 2. In the Standard Model, their cross sections coincide at high energies, being given by (9). V. NONRESONANT BACKGROUND By nonresonant background we mean those channels in e+e−(µ+µ−) scattering that produce exactly the same ﬁnal states as above, W ∓ρ±, without, however, exciting the Glashow resonance. The possible leading order background can in general be represented by two s-channel Feynman diagrams with γ and Z exchanges as shown in Fig. 3. For completeness, one could also add a similar graph with an intermediate Higgs boson, but we ignore it. In principle, the vertices γWρ and ZWρ may arise in eﬀective theories like vector meson dominance extended to weak interactions [46]. Anyway, these diagrams would yield terms in a cross section behaving like ∼m2 W /s2 as s grows, and without the logarithmic enhancement. As a result, the related contribution will decrease much faster with energy than 1/s ln(s/m2 ρ) following from (9).

It is interesting to speculate on the possibility for the parameters to depend on the momentum transfer squared.

Precision measurements at a 125 GeV muon collider that would provide integrated luminosity of 20 ab−1 have already been discussed [54]. VII. CONCLUSIONS Due to the existence of the radiative return, one can measure the cross section for the s-channel annihilation e+e−→X in a relatively wide range of ﬁnal state masses, mX, using only one collider operating at a ﬁxed cms energy [29]. As a result, the annihilation is explored in reactions of the form e+e−→Xγ. Without this mechanism, in order to carry out the same task, one would have to obtain new e± beams for each value of mX. There are mesons that also couple to the leptonic currents. From the kinematical point of view, the diﬀerence between photon emission and emission of such a meson disappears in the high energy limit. Therefore, it seems to be reasonable to assume the existence of the meson analogue of the radiative return. If the meson is positively charged, its emission from the initial state not merely carries away a fraction of the collision energy but converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. In other words, with certain calculable probability the positron interacts as the related antineutrino. We have obtained this probability and suggested a mechanism of initial state charged meson emission. This allowed us to factorize the reaction e+e−→W −ρ+ into two processes and thus put forward a Glashow resonance interpretation of the underlying physics. Similar channels with muons and other mesons have also been considered. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance, its CP conjugate and its copy for muons. Meanwhile, the latter two are widely believed to be inaccessible in neutrino experiments. The reactions might occur already at cms energies of order 100 GeV. We have made rough numerical estimates, so that further analysis will be required. The signal will consist of a single W boson plus a meson or a jet (oppositely charged with respect to W). If the accompanied meson (jet) is not detected, the process will manifest itself as merely a single W boson. The energy region of interest, by the way, have been investigated in the LEP experiments at CERN [55]. It might be therefore interesting to look for the signals among the ﬁnal states with a single W measured by LEP [56, 57], at least for constraining the parameters. Acknowledgments."

Instantaneous luminosities at these colliders are foreseen to be of order 1036 cm−2s−1 which could lead to a rate greater than 10 events/year from the W ∓ρ± channel only. Taking into account a more complete set of allowed mesons will further increase the number of events expected in a laboratory. For comparison, IceCube observes less than 1 event per year in the resonance energy region [3, 9, 10]. We would like to highlight the important role played by the decay constants in determining the observables. Being nonperturbative, these parameters are not known precisely. Diﬀerent models give more o less diﬀerent values (see, e.g., [53]). To stress the fact that the related uncertainties may signiﬁcantly aﬀect numerical predictions, we have used two diﬀerent values of the constants for each channel (see Table I). It is interesting to speculate on the possibility for the parameters to depend on the momentum transfer squared. For example, their growth in high energy reactions would lead to an enhancement of the associated event rate. Meanwhile, the decay constants used are originally adopted for the description of the decays of mesons with masses ∼1 GeV [36]. The estimates given in Table I apply equally well to high luminosity µ+µ−collides. As was pointed out in Section IV, the latter could allow us to excite the muon copy of the Glashow resonance in reactions like µ+µ−→ W −D∗+ s and thus to test lepton universality for resonant neutrino interaction at high momentum transfers. Precision measurements at a 125 GeV muon collider that would provide integrated luminosity of 20 ab−1 have already been discussed [54]. VII. CONCLUSIONS Due to the existence of the radiative return, one can measure the cross section for the s-channel annihilation e+e−→X in a relatively wide range of ﬁnal state masses, mX, using only one collider operating at a ﬁxed cms energy [29]. As a result, the annihilation is explored in reactions of the form e+e−→Xγ. Without this mechanism, in order to carry out the same task, one would have to obtain new e± beams for each value of mX. There are mesons that also couple to the leptonic currents. From the kinematical point of view, the diﬀerence between photon emission and emission of such a meson disappears in the high energy limit. Therefore, it seems to be reasonable to assume the existence of the meson analogue of the radiative return. If the meson is positively charged, its emission from the initial state not merely carries away a fraction of the collision energy but converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. In other words, with certain calculable probability the positron interacts as the related antineutrino. We have obtained this probability and suggested a mechanism of initial state charged meson emission. This allowed us to factorize the reaction e+e−→W −ρ+ into two processes and thus put forward a Glashow resonance interpretation of the underlying physics. Similar channels with muons and other mesons have also been considered. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance, its CP conjugate and its copy for muons. Meanwhile, the latter two are widely believed to be inaccessible in neutrino experiments. The reactions might occur already at cms energies of order 100 GeV. We have made rough numerical estimates, so that further analysis will be required. The signal will consist of a single W boson plus a meson or a jet (oppositely charged with respect to W).

We would like to highlight the important role played by the decay constants in determining the observables. Being nonperturbative, these parameters are not known precisely. Diﬀerent models give more o less diﬀerent values (see, e.g., [53]). To stress the fact that the related uncertainties may signiﬁcantly aﬀect numerical predictions, we have used two diﬀerent values of the constants for each channel (see Table I). It is interesting to speculate on the possibility for the parameters to depend on the momentum transfer squared. For example, their growth in high energy reactions would lead to an enhancement of the associated event rate. Meanwhile, the decay constants used are originally adopted for the description of the decays of mesons with masses ∼1 GeV [36]. The estimates given in Table I apply equally well to high luminosity µ+µ−collides. As was pointed out in Section IV, the latter could allow us to excite the muon copy of the Glashow resonance in reactions like µ+µ−→ W −D∗+ s and thus to test lepton universality for resonant neutrino interaction at high momentum transfers. Precision measurements at a 125 GeV muon collider that would provide integrated luminosity of 20 ab−1 have already been discussed [54]. VII. CONCLUSIONS Due to the existence of the radiative return, one can measure the cross section for the s-channel annihilation e+e−→X in a relatively wide range of ﬁnal state masses, mX, using only one collider operating at a ﬁxed cms energy [29]. As a result, the annihilation is explored in reactions of the form e+e−→Xγ. Without this mechanism, in order to carry out the same task, one would have to obtain new e± beams for each value of mX. There are mesons that also couple to the leptonic currents. From the kinematical point of view, the diﬀerence between photon emission and emission of such a meson disappears in the high energy limit. Therefore, it seems to be reasonable to assume the existence of the meson analogue of the radiative return. If the meson is positively charged, its emission from the initial state not merely carries away a fraction of the collision energy but converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. In other words, with certain calculable probability the positron interacts as the related antineutrino. We have obtained this probability and suggested a mechanism of initial state charged meson emission. This allowed us to factorize the reaction e+e−→W −ρ+ into two processes and thus put forward a Glashow resonance interpretation of the underlying physics. Similar channels with muons and other mesons have also been considered. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance, its CP conjugate and its copy for muons. Meanwhile, the latter two are widely believed to be inaccessible in neutrino experiments. The reactions might occur already at cms energies of order 100 GeV. We have made rough numerical estimates, so that further analysis will be required. The signal will consist of a single W boson plus a meson or a jet (oppositely charged with respect to W). If the accompanied meson (jet) is not detected, the process will manifest itself as merely a single W boson. The energy region of interest, by the way, have been investigated in the LEP experiments at CERN [55]. It might be therefore interesting to look for the signals among the ﬁnal states with a single W measured by LEP [56, 57], at least for constraining the parameters. Acknowledgments."

As a result, the annihilation is explored in reactions of the form e+e−→Xγ. Without this mechanism, in order to carry out the same task, one would have to obtain new e± beams for each value of mX. There are mesons that also couple to the leptonic currents. From the kinematical point of view, the diﬀerence between photon emission and emission of such a meson disappears in the high energy limit. Therefore, it seems to be reasonable to assume the existence of the meson analogue of the radiative return. If the meson is positively charged, its emission from the initial state not merely carries away a fraction of the collision energy but converts the incident e+ into ¯νe. In other words, with certain calculable probability the positron interacts as the related antineutrino. We have obtained this probability and suggested a mechanism of initial state charged meson emission. This allowed us to factorize the reaction e+e−→W −ρ+ into two processes and thus put forward a Glashow resonance interpretation of the underlying physics. Similar channels with muons and other mesons have also been considered. Within this viewpoint, future high-luminosity lepton colliders seem to be promising for excitation of the Glashow resonance, its CP conjugate and its copy for muons. Meanwhile, the latter two are widely believed to be inaccessible in neutrino experiments. The reactions might occur already at cms energies of order 100 GeV. We have made rough numerical estimates, so that further analysis will be required. The signal will consist of a single W boson plus a meson or a jet (oppositely charged with respect to W). If the accompanied meson (jet) is not detected, the process will manifest itself as merely a single W boson. The energy region of interest, by the way, have been investigated in the LEP experiments at CERN [55]. It might be therefore interesting to look for the signals among the ﬁnal states with a single W measured by LEP [56, 57], at least for constraining the parameters. Acknowledgments."
